# StylometryProject

This is a Ruby on Rails stylometry project by [Ronnie Nyaga](http://twitter.com/ronnie_nyaga) for his fourth year Computer Science project.


The project uses the Quinlan ID3 algorithm in Decision Trees to learn the written linguistic styles of students in their essays, and thus determine the integrity of the authorship of subsequent essays handed in by the students.

This application is coded using [*Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). The package used for stylometric analysis is the J48 package which is an implementation of the C4.5 ID3 algorithm.

This project uses RJB (Ruby Java Bridge).

Included in this repository is the full system documentation.
