his own amusement never took up any book but the baronetagethere he found occupation for an idle hour and consolation in adistressed one there his faculties were roused into admiration andrespect by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patentsthere any unwelcome sensations arising from domestic affairschanged naturally into pity and contempt as he turned overthe almost endless creations of the last century and thereif every other leaf were powerless he could read his own historywith an interest which never failed  this was the page at whichthe favourite volume always opened           elliot of kellynch hallwalter elliot born march 1 1760 married july 15 1784 elizabethdaughter of james stevenson esq of south park in the county ofgloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue elizabethborn june 1 1785 anne born august 9 1787 a still-born sonnovember 5 1789 mary born november 20 1791precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's handsbut sir walter had improved it by adding for the information ofhimself and his family these words after the date of mary's birth--married december 16 1810 charles son and heir of charlesmusgrove esq of uppercross in the county of somersetand by inserting most accurately the day of the month on whichhe had lost his wifethen followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable familyin the usual terms how it had been first settled in cheshirehow mentioned in dugdale serving the office of high sheriffrepresenting a borough in three successive parliamentsexertions of loyalty and dignity of baronet in the first yearof charles ii with all the marys and elizabeths they had marriedforming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages and concluding withthe arms and motto--principal seat kellynch hall in the countyof somerset and sir walter's handwriting again in this finale--heir presumptive william walter elliot esq great grandson ofthe second sir waltervanity was the beginning and the end of sir walter elliot's charactervanity of person and of situation  he had been remarkably handsomein his youth and at fifty-four was still a very fine manfew women could think more of their personal appearance than he didnor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted withthe place he held in society  he considered the blessing of beautyas inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy and the sir walter elliotwho united these gifts was the constant object of his warmest respectand devotionhis good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachmentsince to them he must have owed a wife of very superior characterto any thing deserved by his own  lady elliot had been an excellent womansensible and amiable whose judgement and conduct if they might bepardoned the youthful infatuation which made her lady elliothad never required indulgence afterwards--she had humouredor softened or concealed his failings and promoted his realrespectability for seventeen years and though not the very happiestbeing in the world herself had found enough in her duties her friendsand her children to attach her to life and make it no matter ofindifference to her when she was called on to quit them--three girls the two eldest sixteen and fourteen was an awful legacyfor a mother to bequeath an awful charge rather to confide tothe authority and guidance of a conceited silly fathershe had however one very intimate friend a sensible deserving womanwho had been brought by strong attachment to herself to settleclose by her in the village of kellynch and on her kindness and advicelady elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance ofthe good principles and instruction which she had been anxiouslygiving her daughtersthis friend and sir walter did not marry whatever might have beenanticipated on that head by their acquaintance  thirteen yearshad passed away since lady elliot's death and they were stillnear neighbours and intimate friends and one remained a widowerthe other a widowthat lady russell of steady age and character and extremelywell provided for should have no thought of a second marriageneeds no apology to the public which is rather apt to be unreasonablydiscontented when a woman does marry again than when she does notbut sir walter's continuing in singleness requires explanationbe it known then that sir walter like a good father having met withone or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applicationsprided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sakefor one daughter his eldest he would really have given up any thingwhich he had not been very much tempted to do  elizabeth had succeededat sixteen to all that was possible of her mother's rightsand consequence and being very handsome and very like himselfher influence had always been great and they had gone on togethermost happily  his two other children were of very inferior valuemary had acquired a little artificial importance by becomingmrs charles musgrove but anne with an elegance of mind and sweetnessof character which must have placed her high with any peopleof real understanding was nobody with either father or sisterher word had no weight her convenience was always to give way--she was only anneto lady russell indeed she was a most dear and highly valuedgod-daughter favourite and friend  lady russell loved them allbut it was only in anne that she could fancy the mother to revive againa few years before anne elliot had been a very pretty girlbut her bloom had vanished early and as even in its heighther father had found little to admire in her so totally differentwere her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his ownthere could be nothing in them now that she was faded and thinto excite his esteem he had never indulged much hope he had now noneof ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite workall equality of alliance must rest with elizabeth for mary had merelyconnected herself with an old country family of respectability andlarge fortune and had therefore given all the honour and received noneelizabeth would one day or other marry suitablyit sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine thanshe was ten years before and generally speaking if there has beenneither ill health nor anxiety it is a time of life at which scarcely anycharm is lost  it was so with elizabeth still the same handsomemiss elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago and sir waltermight be excused therefore in forgetting her age or at leastbe deemed only half a fool for thinking himself and elizabethas blooming as ever amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody elsefor he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family andacquaintance were growing  anne haggard mary coarse every facein the neighbourhood worsting and the rapid increase of the crow's footabout lady russell's temples had long been a distress to himelizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentmentthirteen years had seen her mistress of kellynch hall presiding anddirecting with a self-possession and decision which could never have giventhe idea of her being younger than she was  for thirteen years hadshe been doing the honours and laying down the domestic law at homeand leading the way to the chaise and four and walking immediately afterlady russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the countrythirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ballof credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded and thirteen springsshewn their blossoms as she travelled up to london with her fatherfor a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world  she hadthe remembrance of all this she had the consciousness of beingnine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensionsshe was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as everbut she felt her approach to the years of danger and would have rejoicedto be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood withinthe next twelvemonth or two  then might she again take upthe book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youthbut now she liked it not  always to be presented with the date ofher own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sistermade the book an evil and more than once when her father had left itopen on the table near her had she closed it with averted eyesand pushed it awayshe had had a disappointment moreover which that bookand especially the history of her own family must ever presentthe remembrance of  the heir presumptive the very william walterelliot esq whose rights had been so generously supportedby her father had disappointed hershe had while a very young girl as soon as she had known him to bein the event of her having no brother the future baronetmeant to marry him and her father had always meant that she shouldhe had not been known to them as a boy but soon after lady elliot's deathsir walter had sought the acquaintance and though his overtureshad not been met with any warmth he had persevered in seeking itmaking allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth and in one oftheir spring excursions to london when elizabeth was in her first bloommr elliot had been forced into the introductionhe was at that time a very young man just engaged in the study of the lawand elizabeth found him extremely agreeable and every plan in his favourwas confirmed  he was invited to kellynch hall he was talked ofand expected all the rest of the year but he never camethe following spring he was seen again in town found equally agreeableagain encouraged invited and expected and again he did not comeand the next tidings were that he was married  instead of pushinghis fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of elliothe had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich womanof inferior birthsir walter has resented it  as the head of the house he felt thathe ought to have been consulted especially after taking the young manso publicly by the hand for they must have been seen togetherhe observed once at tattersall's and twice in the lobby ofthe house of commons  his disapprobation was expressedbut apparently very little regarded  mr elliot had attempted no apologyand shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the familyas sir walter considered him unworthy of it  all acquaintance betweenthem had ceasedthis very awkward history of mr elliot was still after an intervalof several years felt with anger by elizabeth who had liked the manfor himself and still more for being her father's heir and whosestrong family pride could see only in him a proper match for sir walterelliot's eldest daughter  there was not a baronet from a to z whomher feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equalyet so miserably had he conducted himself that though she wasat this present time the summer of 1814 wearing black ribbonsfor his wife she could not admit him to be worth thinking of againthe disgrace of his first marriage might perhaps as there wasno reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring have been got overhad he not done worse but he had as by the accustomary interventionof kind friends they had been informed spoken most disrespectfullyof them all most slightingly and contemptuously of the very bloodhe belonged to and the honours which were hereafter to be his ownthis could not be pardonedsuch were elizabeth elliot's sentiments and sensations such the caresto alloy the agitations to vary the sameness and the elegancethe prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of lifesuch the feelings to give interest to a long uneventful residencein one country circle to fill the vacancies which there were no habitsof utility abroad no talents or accomplishments for home to occupybut now another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to beadded to these  her father was growing distressed for moneyshe knew that when he now took up the baronetage it was to drivethe heavy bills of his tradespeople and the unwelcome hints ofmr shepherd his agent from his thoughts  the kellynch property was goodbut not equal to sir walter's apprehension of the state requiredin its possessor  while lady elliot lived there had been methodmoderation and economy which had just kept him within his incomebut with her had died all such right-mindedness and from that periodhe had been constantly exceeding it  it had not been possiblefor him to spend less he had done nothing but what sir walter elliotwas imperiously called on to do but blameless as he was he wasnot only growing dreadfully in debt but was hearing of it so oftenthat it became vain to attempt concealing it longer even partiallyfrom his daughter  he had given her some hints of it the last springin town he had gone so far even as to say can we retrenchdoes it occur to you that there is any one article in whichwe can retrench and elizabeth to do her justice had in the firstardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be doneand had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut offsome unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishingthe drawing-room to which expedients she afterwards addedthe happy thought of their taking no present down to anneas had been the usual yearly custom  but these measureshowever good in themselves were insufficient for the real extentof the evil the whole of which sir walter found himself obligedto confess to her soon afterwards  elizabeth had nothing to proposeof deeper efficacy  she felt herself ill-used and unfortunateas did her father and they were neither of them able to deviseany means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignityor relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be bornethere was only a small part of his estate that sir walter could dispose ofbut had every acre been alienable it would have made no differencehe had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the powerbut he would never condescend to sell  no he would never disgracehis name so far  the kellynch estate should be transmitted wholeand entire as he had received ittheir two confidential friends mr shepherd who lived inthe neighbouring market town and lady russell were called to advise themand both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should bestruck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassmentsand reduce their expenditure without involving the loss ofany indulgence of taste or pridechapter 2mr shepherd a civil cautious lawyer who whatever might be his holdor his views on sir walter would rather have the disagreeableprompted by anybody else excused himself from offering the slightest hintand only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference tothe excellent judgement of lady russell from whose known good sensehe fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised ashe meant to see finally adoptedlady russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject and gave itmuch serious consideration  she was a woman rather of sound than ofquick abilities whose difficulties in coming to any decisionin this instance were great from the opposition of two leading principlesshe was of strict integrity herself with a delicate sense of honourbut she was as desirous of saving sir walter's feelings as solicitousfor the credit of the family as aristocratic in her ideas of whatwas due to them as anybody of sense and honesty could well beshe was a benevolent charitable good woman and capable ofstrong attachments most correct in her conduct strict in her notionsof decorum and with manners that were held a standard of good-breedingshe had a cultivated mind and was generally speakingrational and consistent but she had prejudices on the side of ancestryshe had a value for rank and consequence which blinded her a littleto the faults of those who possessed them  herself the widow ofonly a knight she gave the dignity of a baronet all its dueand sir walter independent of his claims as an old acquaintancean attentive neighbour an obliging landlord the husband of hervery dear friend the father of anne and her sisters wasas being sir walter in her apprehension entitled to a great dealof compassion and consideration under his present difficultiesthey must retrench that did not admit of a doubt  but she wasvery anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to himand elizabeth she drew up plans of economy she made exact calculationsand she did what nobody else thought of doing  she consulted annewho never seemed considered by the others as having any interestin the question she consulted and in a degree was influenced by herin marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submittedto sir walter every emendation of anne's had been on the side ofhonesty against importance  she wanted more vigorous measuresa more complete reformation a quicker release from debta much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equityif we can persuade your father to all this said lady russelllooking over her paper much may be done  if he will adoptthese regulations in seven years he will be clear and i hopewe may be able to convince him and elizabeth that kellynch hall hasa respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductionsand that the true dignity of sir walter elliot will be very far fromlessened in the eyes of sensible people by acting like a man of principlewhat will he be doing in fact but what very many of our first familieshave done or ought to do  there will be nothing singular in his caseand it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our sufferingas it always does of our conduct  i have great hope of prevailingwe must be serious and decided for after all the person whohas contracted debts must pay them and though a great deal is due tothe feelings of the gentleman and the head of a house like your fatherthere is still more due to the character of an honest manthis was the principle on which anne wanted her father to be proceedinghis friends to be urging him  she considered it as an actof indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors withall the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchmentscould secure and saw no dignity in anything short of itshe wanted it to be prescribed and felt as a duty  she ratedlady russell's influence highly and as to the severe degreeof self-denial which her own conscience prompted she believedthere might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a completethan to half a reformation  her knowledge of her fatherand elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pairof horses would be hardly less painful than of both and so onthrough the whole list of lady russell's too gentle reductionshow anne's more rigid requisitions might have been takenis of little consequence  lady russell's had no success at allcould not be put up with were not to be borne what! every comfortof life knocked off!  journeys london servants horses table--contractions and restrictions every where!  to live no longerwith the decencies even of a private gentleman!  no he would soonerquit kellynch hall at once than remain in it on such disgraceful termsquit kellynch hall  the hint was immediately taken up by mr shepherdwhose interest was involved in the reality of sir walter's retrenchingand who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done withouta change of abode  since the idea had been started in the very quarterwhich ought to dictate he had no scruple he said in confessinghis judgement to be entirely on that side  it did not appear to himthat sir walter could materially alter his style of living in a housewhich had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to supportin any other place sir walter might judge for himself and wouldbe looked up to as regulating the modes of life in whatever wayhe might choose to model his householdsir walter would quit kellynch hall and after a very few days moreof doubt and indecision the great question of whither he should gowas settled and the first outline of this important change made outthere had been three alternatives london bath or another housein the country  all anne's wishes had been for the lattera small house in their own neighbourhood where they might still havelady russell's society still be near mary and still have the pleasureof sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of kellynch was the objectof her ambition  but the usual fate of anne attended herin having something very opposite from her inclination fixed onshe disliked bath and did not think it agreed with herand bath was to be her homesir walter had at first thought more of london but mr shepherd feltthat he could not be trusted in london and had been skilful enoughto dissuade him from it and make bath preferred  it was a much saferplace for a gentleman in his predicament  he might there be importantat comparatively little expense  two material advantages of bathover london had of course been given all their weight  its more convenientdistance from kellynch only fifty miles and lady russell's spendingsome part of every winter there and to the very great satisfactionof lady russell whose first views on the projected change had beenfor bath sir walter and elizabeth were induced to believe thatthey should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling therelady russell felt obliged to oppose her dear anne's known wishesit would be too much to expect sir walter to descend into a small housein his own neighbourhood  anne herself would have foundthe mortifications of it more than she foresaw and to sir walter'sfeelings they must have been dreadful  and with regard to anne'sdislike of bath she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arisingfirst from the circumstance of her having been three yearsat school there after her mother's death and secondlyfrom her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winterwhich she had afterwards spent there with herselflady russell was fond of bath in short and disposed to thinkit must suit them all and as to her young friend's healthby passing all the warm months with her at kellynch lodgeevery danger would be avoided and it was in fact a change which mustdo both health and spirits good  anne had been too little from hometoo little seen her spirits were not high  a larger societywould improve them  she wanted her to be more knownthe undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhoodfor sir walter was certainly much strengthened by one partand a very material part of the scheme which had been happilyengrafted on the beginning  he was not only to quit his homebut to see it in the hands of others a trial of fortitudewhich stronger heads than sir walter's have found too muchkellynch hall was to be let  this however was a profound secretnot to be breathed beyond their own circlesir walter could not have borne the degradation of being knownto design letting his house  mr shepherd had once mentioned the wordadvertise but never dared approach it again  sir walter spurnedthe idea of its being offered in any manner forbad the slightest hintbeing dropped of his having such an intention and it was only onthe supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some mostunexceptionable applicant on his own terms and as a great favourthat he would let it at allhow quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  lady russell hadanother excellent one at hand for being extremely glad that sir walterand his family were to remove from the country  elizabeth had beenlately forming an intimacy which she wished to see interruptedit was with the daughter of mr shepherd who had returnedafter an unprosperous marriage to her father's house withthe additional burden of two children  she was a clever young womanwho understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing at leastat kellynch hall and who had made herself so acceptable to miss elliotas to have been already staying there more than once in spite of allthat lady russell who thought it a friendship quite out of placecould hint of caution and reservelady russell indeed had scarcely any influence with elizabethand seemed to love her rather because she would love herthan because elizabeth deserved it  she had never received from her morethan outward attention nothing beyond the observances of complaisancehad never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carryagainst previous inclination  she had been repeatedly very earnestin trying to get anne included in the visit to london sensibly opento all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangementswhich shut her out and on many lesser occasions had endeavouredto give elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experiencebut always in vain  elizabeth would go her own way and never had shepursued it in more decided opposition to lady russell than inthis selection of mrs clay turning from the society of so deservinga sister to bestow her affection and confidence on one who oughtto have been nothing to her but the object of distant civilityfrom situation mrs clay was in lady russell's estimate a very unequaland in her character she believed a very dangerous companionand a removal that would leave mrs clay behind and bring a choiceof more suitable intimates within miss elliot's reach was thereforean object of first-rate importancechapter 3i must take leave to observe sir walter said mr shepherdone morning at kellynch hall as he laid down the newspaperthat the present juncture is much in our favour  this peace willbe turning all our rich naval officers ashore  they will beall wanting a home  could not be a better time sir walterfor having a choice of tenants very responsible tenantsmany a noble fortune has been made during the war  if a rich admiralwere to come in our way sir walter--he would be a very lucky man shepherd replied sir walterthat's all i have to remark  a prize indeed would kellynch hallbe to him rather the greatest prize of all let him have takenever so many before hey shepherdmr shepherd laughed as he knew he must at this wit and then added--i presume to observe sir walter that in the way of businessgentlemen of the navy are well to deal with  i have had a little knowledgeof their methods of doing business and i am free to confess that theyhave very liberal notions and are as likely to make desirable tenantsas any set of people one should meet with  therefore sir walterwhat i would take leave to suggest is that if in consequence ofany rumours getting abroad of your intention which must be contemplatedas a possible thing because we know how difficult it is to keepthe actions and designs of one part of the world from the noticeand curiosity of the other consequence has its tax i john shepherdmight conceal any family-matters that i chose for nobody would think itworth their while to observe me but sir walter elliot has eyes upon himwhich it may be very difficult to elude and therefore thus muchi venture upon that it will not greatly surprise me ifwith all our caution some rumour of the truth should get abroadin the supposition of which as i was going to observe since applicationswill unquestionably follow i should think any from our wealthynaval commanders particularly worth attending to and beg leave to addthat two hours will bring me over at any time to save youthe trouble of replyingsir walter only nodded  but soon afterwards rising and pacing the roomhe observed sarcastically--there are few among the gentlemen of the navy i imagine who wouldnot be surprised to find themselves in a house of this descriptionthey would look around them no doubt and bless their good fortunesaid mrs clay for mrs clay was present  her father had driven her overnothing being of so much use to mrs clay's health as a drive to kellynchbut i quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might bea very desirable tenant  i have known a good deal of the professionand besides their liberality they are so neat and carefulin all their ways!  these valuable pictures of yours sir walterif you chose to leave them would be perfectly safe  everything inand about the house would be taken such excellent care of!the gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high orderas they are now  you need not be afraid miss elliot of your ownsweet flower gardens being neglectedas to all that rejoined sir walter coolly supposing i were inducedto let my house i have by no means made up my mind as to the privilegesto be annexed to it  i am not particularly disposed to favour a tenantthe park would be open to him of course and few navy officersor men of any other description can have had such a rangebut what restrictions i might impose on the use of the pleasure-groundsis another thing  i am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies beingalways approachable and i should recommend miss elliot to be on her guardwith respect to her flower garden  i am very little disposedto grant a tenant of kellynch hall any extraordinary favouri assure you be he sailor or soldierafter a short pause mr shepherd presumed to say--in all these cases there are established usages whichmake everything plain and easy between landlord and tenantyour interest sir walter is in pretty safe hands  depend upon mefor taking care that no tenant has more than his just rightsi venture to hint that sir walter elliot cannot be half so jealousfor his own as john shepherd will be for himhere anne spoke--the navy i think who have done so much for us have at leastan equal claim with any other set of men for all the comforts andall the privileges which any home can give  sailors work hard enoughfor their comforts we must all allowvery true very true  what miss anne says is very truewas mr shepherd's rejoinder and oh! certainly was his daughter'sbut sir walter's remark was soon afterwards--the profession has its utility but i should be sorry to seeany friend of mine belonging to itindeed! was the reply and with a look of surpriseyes it is in two points offensive to me i have two strong groundsof objection to it  first as being the means of bringing personsof obscure birth into undue distinction and raising men to honourswhich their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of and secondlyas it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly a sailor grows oldsooner than any other man  i have observed it all my lifea man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the riseof one whose father his father might have disdained to speak toand of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself than inany other line  one day last spring in town i was in companywith two men striking instances of what i am talking oflord st ives whose father we all know to have been a country curatewithout bread to eat i was to give place to lord st ivesand a certain admiral baldwin the most deplorable-looking personageyou can imagine his face the colour of mahogany rough and ruggedto the last degree all lines and wrinkles nine grey hairs of a sideand nothing but a dab of powder at top  `in the name of heavenwho is that old fellow' said i to a friend of mine who was standing nearsir basil morley  `old fellow!' cried sir basil `it is admiral baldwinwhat do you take his age to be'  `sixty' said i `or perhaps sixty-two'`forty' replied sir basil `forty and no more'  picture to yourselvesmy amazement i shall not easily forget admiral baldwini never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can dobut to a degree i know it is the same with them all  they are allknocked about and exposed to every climate and every weathertill they are not fit to be seen  it is a pity they are not knockedon the head at once before they reach admiral baldwin's agenay sir walter cried mrs clay this is being severe indeedhave a little mercy on the poor men  we are not all born to be handsomethe sea is no beautifier certainly sailors do grow old betimesi have observed it they soon lose the look of youth  but thenis not it the same with many other professions perhaps most othersoldiers in active service are not at all better off  and even inthe quieter professions there is a toil and a labour of the mindif not of the body which seldom leaves a man's looks to the naturaleffect of time  the lawyer plods quite care-worn the physicianis up at all hours and travelling in all weather and eventhe clergyman-- she stopt a moment to consider what mightdo for the clergyman--and even the clergyman you know is obligedto go into infected rooms and expose his health and looks toall the injury of a poisonous atmosphere  in fact as i havelong been convinced though every profession is necessary and honourablein its turn it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow anywho can live in a regular way in the country choosing their own hoursfollowing their own pursuits and living on their own propertywithout the torment of trying for more it is only their lot i sayto hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmosti know no other set of men but what lose something of their personablenesswhen they cease to be quite youngit seemed as if mr shepherd in this anxiety to bespeaksir walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenanthad been gifted with foresight for the very first applicationfor the house was from an admiral croft with whom he shortly afterwardsfell into company in attending the quarter sessions at taunton and indeedhe had received a hint of the admiral from a london correspondentby the report which he hastened over to kellynch to makeadmiral croft was a native of somersetshire who having acquireda very handsome fortune was wishing to settle in his own countryand had come down to taunton in order to look at some advertised placesin that immediate neighbourhood which however had not suited himthat accidentally hearing--it was just as he had foretoldmr shepherd observed sir walter's concerns could not be kept a secret--accidentally hearing of the possibility of kellynch hall being to letand understanding his mr shepherd's connection with the ownerhe had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiriesand had in the course of a pretty long conference expressed as strongan inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by descriptioncould feel and given mr shepherd in his explicit account of himselfevery proof of his being a most responsible eligible tenantand who is admiral croft was sir walter's cold suspicious inquirymr shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's familyand mentioned a place and anne after the little pause which followedadded--he is a rear admiral of the white  he was in the trafalgar actionand has been in the east indies since he was stationed therei believe several yearsthen i take it for granted observed sir walter that his faceis about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my liverymr shepherd hastened to assure him that admiral croft was a very halehearty well-looking man a little weather-beaten to be surebut not much and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviournot likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms only wanteda comfortable home and to get into it as soon as possibleknew he must pay for his convenience knew what rent a ready-furnishedhouse of that consequence might fetch should not have been surprisedif sir walter had asked more had inquired about the manorwould be glad of the deputation certainly but made no great point of itsaid he sometimes took out a gun but never killed quite the gentlemanmr shepherd was eloquent on the subject pointing out allthe circumstances of the admiral's family which made himpeculiarly desirable as a tenant  he was a married manand without children the very state to be wished for  a house wasnever taken good care of mr shepherd observed without a ladyhe did not know whether furniture might not be in danger of sufferingas much where there was no lady as where there were many childrena lady without a family was the very best preserver of furniturein the world  he had seen mrs croft too she was at tauntonwith the admiral and had been present almost all the time they weretalking the matter overand a very well-spoken genteel shrewd lady she seemed to becontinued he asked more questions about the house and termsand taxes than the admiral himself and seemed more conversantwith business and moreover sir walter i found she was not quiteunconnected in this country any more than her husband that is to sayshe is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us onceshe told me so herself  sister to the gentleman who liveda few years back at monkford  bless me! what was his nameat this moment i cannot recollect his name though i have heard it so latelypenelope my dear can you help me to the name of the gentlemanwho lived at monkford  mrs croft's brotherbut mrs clay was talking so eagerly with miss elliot that she did nothear the appeali have no conception whom you can mean shepherd i rememberno gentleman resident at monkford since the time of old governor trentbless me! how very odd!  i shall forget my own name soon i supposea name that i am so very well acquainted with knew the gentlemanso well by sight seen him a hundred times came to consult me oncei remember about a trespass of one of his neighbours farmer's manbreaking into his orchard wall torn down apples stolencaught in the fact and afterwards contrary to my judgementsubmitted to an amicable compromise  very odd indeed!after waiting another moment--you mean mr wentworth i suppose said annemr shepherd was all gratitudewentworth was the very name!  mr wentworth was the very manhe had the curacy of monkford you know sir walter some time backfor two or three years  came there about the year ---5 i take ityou remember him i am surewentworth  oh! ay--mr wentworth the curate of monkfordyou misled me by the term gentleman  i thought you were speaking ofsome man of property  mr wentworth was nobody i rememberquite unconnected nothing to do with the strafford familyone wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so commonas mr shepherd perceived that this connexion of the crofts did themno service with sir walter he mentioned it no more returningwith all his zeal to dwell on the circumstances more indisputablyin their favour their age and number and fortune the high ideathey had formed of kellynch hall and extreme solicitude forthe advantage of renting it making it appear as if they rankednothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of sir walter elliotan extraordinary taste certainly could they have been supposed inthe secret of sir walter's estimate of the dues of a tenantit succeeded however and though sir walter must ever look withan evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house and think theminfinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest termshe was talked into allowing mr shepherd to proceed in the treatyand authorising him to wait on admiral croft who still remainedat taunton and fix a day for the house being seensir walter was not very wise but still he had experience enoughof the world to feel that a more unobjectionable tenantin all essentials than admiral croft bid fair to be could hardly offerso far went his understanding and his vanity supplied a littleadditional soothing in the admiral's situation in life which was justhigh enough and not too high  i have let my house to admiral croftwould sound extremely well very much better than to any mere mr--a mr save perhaps some half dozen in the nation always needsa note of explanation  an admiral speaks his own consequenceand at the same time can never make a baronet look smallin all their dealings and intercourse sir walter elliot must everhave the precedencenothing could be done without a reference to elizabethbut her inclination was growing so strong for a removalthat she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at handand not a word to suspend decision was uttered by hermr shepherd was completely empowered to act and no sooner hadsuch an end been reached than anne who had been a most attentive listenerto the whole left the room to seek the comfort of cool air for herflushed cheeks and as she walked along a favourite grove saidwith a gentle sigh a few months more and he perhapsmay be walking herechapter 4he was not mr wentworth the former curate of monkfordhowever suspicious appearances may be but a captain frederick wentworthhis brother who being made commander in consequence of the actionoff st domingo and not immediately employed had come into somersetshirein the summer of 1806 and having no parent living found a homefor half a year at monkford  he was at that time a remarkably fineyoung man with a great deal of intelligence spirit and brilliancyand anne an extremely pretty girl with gentleness modesty tasteand feeling  half the sum of attraction on either side might havebeen enough for he had nothing to do and she had hardly anybody to lovebut the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not failthey were gradually acquainted and when acquainted rapidly anddeeply in love  it would be difficult to say which had seenhighest perfection in the other or which had been the happiestshe in receiving his declarations and proposals or he inhaving them accepteda short period of exquisite felicity followed and but a short onetroubles soon arose  sir walter on being applied to without actuallywithholding his consent or saying it should never be gave it allthe negative of great astonishment great coldness great silenceand a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughterhe thought it a very degrading alliance and lady russell though withmore tempered and pardonable pride received it as a most unfortunate oneanne elliot with all her claims of birth beauty and mindto throw herself away at nineteen involve herself at nineteenin an engagement with a young man who had nothing but himselfto recommend him and no hopes of attaining affluence but in the chancesof a most uncertain profession and no connexions to secureeven his farther rise in the profession would be indeed a throwing awaywhich she grieved to think of!  anne elliot so young known to so fewto be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortuneor rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing anxiousyouth-killing dependence!  it must not be if by any fair interferenceof friendship any representations from one who had almost a mother's loveand mother's rights it would be preventedcaptain wentworth had no fortune  he had been lucky in his professionbut spending freely what had come freely had realized nothingbut he was confident that he should soon be richfull of life and ardour he knew that he should soon have a shipand soon be on a station that would lead to everything he wantedhe had always been lucky he knew he should be so stillsuch confidence powerful in its own warmth and bewitching inthe wit which often expressed it must have been enough for annebut lady russell saw it very differently  his sanguine temperand fearlessness of mind operated very differently on hershe saw in it but an aggravation of the evil  it only added adangerous character to himself  he was brilliant he was headstronglady russell had little taste for wit and of anything approachingto imprudence a horror  she deprecated the connexion in every lightsuch opposition as these feelings produced was more thananne could combat  young and gentle as she was it might yethave been possible to withstand her father's ill-willthough unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sisterbut lady russell whom she had always loved and relied on could notwith such steadiness of opinion and such tenderness of mannerbe continually advising her in vain  she was persuaded to believethe engagement a wrong thing  indiscreet improper hardly capableof success and not deserving it  but it was not a merely selfish cautionunder which she acted in putting an end to it  had she notimagined herself consulting his good even more than her ownshe could hardly have given him up  the belief of being prudentand self-denying principally for his advantage was her chief consolationunder the misery of a parting a final parting and every consolationwas required for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinionson his side totally unconvinced and unbending and of his feeling himselfill used by so forced a relinquishment  he had left the countryin consequencea few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintancebut not with a few months ended anne's share of suffering from ither attachment and regrets had for a long time clouded everyenjoyment of youth and an early loss of bloom and spiritshad been their lasting effectmore than seven years were gone since this little historyof sorrowful interest had reached its close and time hadsoftened down much perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to himbut she had been too dependent on time alone no aid had been givenin change of place except in one visit to bath soon after the ruptureor in any novelty or enlargement of society  no one had evercome within the kellynch circle who could bear a comparison withfrederick wentworth as he stood in her memory  no second attachmentthe only thoroughly natural happy and sufficient cureat her time of life had been possible to the nice tone of her mindthe fastidiousness of her taste in the small limits of the societyaround them  she had been solicited when about two-and-twentyto change her name by the young man who not long afterwards founda more willing mind in her younger sister and lady russell hadlamented her refusal for charles musgrove was the eldest son of a manwhose landed property and general importance were second in that countryonly to sir walter's and of good character and appearanceand however lady russell might have asked yet for something morewhile anne was nineteen she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-twoso respectably removed from the partialities and injustice ofher father's house and settled so permanently near herselfbut in this case anne had left nothing for advice to doand though lady russell as satisfied as ever with her own discretionnever wished the past undone she began now to have the anxietywhich borders on hopelessness for anne's being tempted by some manof talents and independence to enter a state for which she held herto be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habitsthey knew not each other's opinion either its constancy or its changeon the one leading point of anne's conduct for the subject was neveralluded to but anne at seven-and-twenty thought very differentlyfrom what she had been made to think at nineteen  she did not blamelady russell she did not blame herself for having been guided by herbut she felt that were any young person in similar circumstancesto apply to her for counsel they would never receive any of suchcertain immediate wretchedness such uncertain future goodshe was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at homeand every anxiety attending his profession all their probable fearsdelays and disappointments she should yet have been a happier womanin maintaining the engagement than she had been in the sacrifice of itand this she fully believed had the usual share had even more thanthe usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirswithout reference to the actual results of their case whichas it happened would have bestowed earlier prosperity thancould be reasonably calculated on  all his sanguine expectationsall his confidence had been justified  his genius and ardourhad seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous pathhe had very soon after their engagement ceased got employand all that he had told her would follow had taken placehe had distinguished himself and early gained the other step in rankand must now by successive captures have made a handsome fortuneshe had only navy lists and newspapers for her authoritybut she could not doubt his being rich and in favour of his constancyshe had no reason to believe him marriedhow eloquent could anne elliot have been! how eloquent at leastwere her wishes on the side of early warm attachment and a cheerfulconfidence in futurity against that over-anxious caution whichseems to insult exertion and distrust providence!  she had been forcedinto prudence in her youth she learned romance as she grew olderthe natural sequel of an unnatural beginningwith all these circumstances recollections and feelingsshe could not hear that captain wentworth's sister was likelyto live at kellynch without a revival of former pain and many a strolland many a sigh were necessary to dispel the agitation of the ideashe often told herself it was folly before she could harden her nervessufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the croftsand their business no evil  she was assisted however by thatperfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness among the only threeof her own friends in the secret of the past which seemed almost to denyany recollection of it  she could do justice to the superiorityof lady russell's motives in this over those of her father and elizabethshe could honour all the better feelings of her calmnessbut the general air of oblivion among them was highly importantfrom whatever it sprung and in the event of admiral croft's reallytaking kellynch hall she rejoiced anew over the conviction whichhad always been most grateful to her of the past being known tothose three only among her connexions by whom no syllableshe believed would ever be whispered and in the trust that among histhe brother only with whom he had been residing had receivedany information of their short-lived engagement  that brother had beenlong removed from the country and being a sensible man and moreovera single man at the time she had a fond dependence on no human creature'shaving heard of it from himthe sister mrs croft had then been out of england accompanyingher husband on a foreign station and her own sister maryhad been at school while it all occurred and never admitted bythe pride of some and the delicacy of others to the smallest knowledgeof it afterwardswith these supports she hoped that the acquaintance between herselfand the crofts which with lady russell still resident in kellynchand mary fixed only three miles off must be anticipatedneed not involve any particular awkwardnesschapter 5on the morning appointed for admiral and mrs croft's seeing kellynch hallanne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to lady russell'sand keep out of the way till all was over when she found it most naturalto be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing themthis meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactoryand decided the whole business at once  each lady was previouslywell disposed for an agreement and saw nothing thereforebut good manners in the other and with regard to the gentlementhere was such an hearty good humour such an open trusting liberalityon the admiral's side as could not but influence sir walterwho had besides been flattered into his very best and most polishedbehaviour by mr shepherd's assurances of his being known by reportto the admiral as a model of good breedingthe house and grounds and furniture were approved the croftswere approved terms time every thing and every body was rightand mr shepherd's clerks were set to work without there having beena single preliminary difference to modify of all thatthis indenture shewethsir walter without hesitation declared the admiral to bethe best-looking sailor he had ever met with and went so far as to saythat if his own man might have had the arranging of his hairhe should not be ashamed of being seen with him any whereand the admiral with sympathetic cordiality observed to his wifeas they drove back through the park i thought we should sooncome to a deal my dear in spite of what they told us at tauntonthe baronet will never set the thames on fire but there seems to beno harm in him  reciprocal compliments which would have beenesteemed about equalthe crofts were to have possession at michaelmas and as sir walterproposed removing to bath in the course of the preceding monththere was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangementlady russell convinced that anne would not be allowed to be of any useor any importance in the choice of the house which they weregoing to secure was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soonand wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she mightconvey her to bath herself after christmas but having engagementsof her own which must take her from kellynch for several weeksshe was unable to give the full invitation she wished and annethough dreading the possible heats of september in all the white glareof bath and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sadof the autumnal months in the country did not think thateverything considered she wished to remain  it would be most rightand most wise and therefore must involve least sufferingto go with the otherssomething occurred however to give her a different dutymary often a little unwell and always thinking a great dealof her own complaints and always in the habit of claiming annewhen anything was the matter was indisposed and foreseeingthat she should not have a day's health all the autumn entreatedor rather required her for it was hardly entreaty to come touppercross cottage and bear her company as long as she should want herinstead of going to bathi cannot possibly do without anne was mary's reasoningand elizabeth's reply was then i am sure anne had better stayfor nobody will want her in bathto be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at leastbetter than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad tobe thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a dutyand certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the countryand her own dear country readily agreed to staythis invitation of mary's removed all lady russell's difficultiesand it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bathtill lady russell took her and that all the intervening timeshould be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodgeso far all was perfectly right but lady russell was almost startledby the wrong of one part of the kellynch hall plan when it burst on herwhich was mrs clay's being engaged to go to bath with sir walterand elizabeth as a most important and valuable assistant to the latterin all the business before her  lady russell was extremely sorrythat such a measure should have been resorted to at all wonderedgrieved and feared and the affront it contained to annein mrs clay's being of so much use while anne could be of nonewas a very sore aggravationanne herself was become hardened to such affronts but she feltthe imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as lady russellwith a great deal of quiet observation and a knowledgewhich she often wished less of her father's character she wassensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacywere more than possible  she did not imagine that her fatherhad at present an idea of the kind  mrs clay had frecklesand a projecting tooth and a clumsy wrist which he was continuallymaking severe remarks upon in her absence but she was youngand certainly altogether well-looking and possessed in an acute mindand assiduous pleasing manners infinitely more dangerous attractionsthan any merely personal might have been  anne was so impressedby the degree of their danger that she could not excuse herselffrom trying to make it perceptible to her sister  she had little hopeof success but elizabeth who in the event of such a reverse would beso much more to be pitied than herself should never she thoughthave reason to reproach her for giving no warningshe spoke and seemed only to offend  elizabeth could not conceivehow such an absurd suspicion should occur to her and indignantlyanswered for each party's perfectly knowing their situationmrs clay said she warmly never forgets who she isand as i am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can bei can assure you that upon the subject of marriage they areparticularly nice and that she reprobates all inequality of conditionand rank more strongly than most people  and as to my fatheri really should not have thought that he who has kept himself singleso long for our sakes need be suspected now  if mrs clay werea very beautiful woman i grant you it might be wrong to have herso much with me not that anything in the world i am surewould induce my father to make a degrading match but he mightbe rendered unhappy  but poor mrs clay who with all her meritscan never have been reckoned tolerably pretty i really think poormrs clay may be staying here in perfect safety  one would imagineyou had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunesthough i know you must fifty times  that tooth of her'sand those freckles  freckles do not disgust me so very muchas they do him  i have known a face not materially disfigured by a fewbut he abominates them  you must have heard him noticemrs clay's frecklesthere is hardly any personal defect replied annewhich an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one toi think very differently answered elizabeth shortlyan agreeable manner may set off handsome features but can neveralter plain ones  however at any rate as i have a great deal moreat stake on this point than anybody else can have i think itrather unnecessary in you to be advising meanne had done glad that it was over and not absolutely hopelessof doing good  elizabeth though resenting the suspicionmight yet be made observant by itthe last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw sir waltermiss elliot and mrs clay to bath  the party drove off in very good spiritssir walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflictedtenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselvesand anne walked up at the same time in a sort of desolate tranquillityto the lodge where she was to spend the first weekher friend was not in better spirits than herself lady russell felt thisbreak-up of the family exceedingly  their respectability wasas dear to her as her own and a daily intercourse had becomeprecious by habit  it was painful to look upon their deserted groundsand still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall intoand to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a villageand be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrivedshe had determined to make her own absence from home beginwhen she must give up anne  accordingly their removal was made togetherand anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stageof lady russell's journeyuppercross was a moderate-sized village which a few years backhad been completely in the old english style containing onlytwo houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourersthe mansion of the squire with its high walls great gates and old treessubstantial and unmodernized and the compact tight parsonageenclosed in its own neat garden with a vine and a pear-treetrained round its casements but upon the marriage of the young 'squireit had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottagefor his residence and uppercross cottage with its verandafrench windows and other prettiness was quite as likely to catchthe traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspectand premises of the great house about a quarter of a mile farther onhere anne had often been staying  she knew the ways of uppercrossas well as those of kellynch  the two families were so continually meetingso much in the habit of running in and out of each other's houseat all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alonebut being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almosta matter of course  though better endowed than the elder sistermary had not anne's understanding nor temper  while well and happyand properly attended to she had great good humour and excellent spiritsbut any indisposition sunk her completely  she had no resourcesfor solitude and inheriting a considerable share of the elliotself-importance was very prone to add to every other distressthat of fancying herself neglected and ill-used  in person she wasinferior to both sisters and had even in her bloom only reachedthe dignity of being a fine girl  she was now lying on the faded sofaof the pretty little drawing-room the once elegant furniture of whichhad been gradually growing shabby under the influence of four summersand two children and on anne's appearing greeted her with--so you are come at last!  i began to think i should never see youi am so ill i can hardly speak  i have not seen a creaturethe whole morning!i am sorry to find you unwell replied anne  you sent mesuch a good account of yourself on thursday!yes i made the best of it i always do  but i was very far from wellat the time and i do not think i ever was so ill in my lifeas i have been all this morning  very unfit to be left alone i am suresuppose i were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful wayand not able to ring the bell!  so lady russell would not get outi do not think she has been in this house three times this summeranne said what was proper and enquired after her husbandoh! charles is out shooting  i have not seen him since seven o'clockhe would go though i told him how ill i was  he said he should notstay out long but he has never come back and now it is almost onei assure you i have not seen a soul this whole long morningyou have had your little boys with youyes as long as i could bear their noise but they are so unmanageablethat they do me more harm than good  little charles does not minda word i say and walter is growing quite as badwell you will soon be better now replied anne cheerfullyyou know i always cure you when i come  how are your neighboursat the great housei can give you no account of them  i have not seen one of them to-dayexcept mr musgrove who just stopped and spoke through the windowbut without getting off his horse and though i told him how ill i wasnot one of them have been near me  it did not happen to suitthe miss musgroves i suppose and they never put themselvesout of their wayyou will see them yet perhaps before the morning is goneit is earlyi never want them i assure you  they talk and laugh a great dealtoo much for me  oh! anne i am so very unwell!  it was quite unkindof you not to come on thursdaymy dear mary recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!you wrote in the cheerfullest manner and said you were perfectly welland in no hurry for me and that being the case you must be awarethat my wish would be to remain with lady russell to the lastand besides what i felt on her account i have really been so busyhave had so much to do that i could not very conveniently haveleft kellynch soonerdear me! what can you possibly have to doa great many things i assure you  more than i can recollectin a moment but i can tell you some  i have been makinga duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and picturesi have been several times in the garden with mackenzietrying to understand and make him understand which of elizabeth's plantsare for lady russell  i have had all my own little concernsto arrange books and music to divide and all my trunks to repackfrom not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggonsand one thing i have had to do mary of a more trying naturegoing to almost every house in the parish as a sort of take-leavei was told that they wished it  but all these things took upa great deal of timeoh! well! and after a moment's pause but you have never asked meone word about our dinner at the pooles yesterdaydid you go then  i have made no enquiries because i concludedyou must have been obliged to give up the partyoh yes! i went  i was very well yesterday nothing at allthe matter with me till this morning  it would have been strangeif i had not gonei am very glad you were well enough and i hope you had a pleasant partynothing remarkable  one always knows beforehand what the dinner will beand who will be there and it is so very uncomfortable not havinga carriage of one's own  mr and mrs musgrove took me and we wereso crowded!  they are both so very large and take up so much roomand mr musgrove always sits forward  so there was i crowded intothe back seat with henrietta and louise and i think it very likelythat my illness to-day may be owing to ita little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulnesson anne's side produced nearly a cure on mary's  she could soonsit upright on the sofa and began to hope she might be ableto leave it by dinner-time  then forgetting to think of itshe was at the other end of the room beautifying a nosegaythen she ate her cold meat and then she was well enoughto propose a little walkwhere shall we go said she when they were ready  i supposeyou will not like to call at the great house before they havebeen to see youi have not the smallest objection on that account replied annei should never think of standing on such ceremony with people i knowso well as mrs and the miss musgrovesoh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possiblethey ought to feel what is due to you as my sister  howeverwe may as well go and sit with them a little  while and when wehave that over we can enjoy our walkanne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudentbut she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing thatthough there were on each side continual subjects of offenceneither family could now do without it  to the great house accordinglythey went to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlourwith a small carpet and shining floor to which the presentdaughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusionby a grand piano-forte and a harp flower-stands and little tablesplaced in every direction  oh! could the originals of the portraitsagainst the wainscot could the gentlemen in brown velvet andthe ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on have been consciousof such an overthrow of all order and neatness!  the portraits themselvesseemed to be staring in astonishmentthe musgroves like their houses were in a state of alterationperhaps of improvement  the father and mother were in the oldenglish style and the young people in the new  mr and mrs musgrovewere a very good sort of people friendly and hospitablenot much educated and not at all elegant  their children hadmore modern minds and manners  there was a numerous familybut the only two grown up excepting charles were henrietta and louisayoung ladies of nineteen and twenty who had brought from school at exeterall the usual stock of accomplishments and were now like thousandsof other young ladies living to be fashionable happy and merrytheir dress had every advantage their faces were rather prettytheir spirits extremely good their manner unembarrassed and pleasantthey were of consequence at home and favourites abroadanne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creaturesof her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by somecomfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibilityof exchange she would not have given up her own more elegantand cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothingbut that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement togetherthat good-humoured mutual affection of which she had knownso little herself with either of her sistersthey were received with great cordiality  nothing seemed amisson the side of the great house family which was generallyas anne very well knew the least to blame  the half hour waschatted away pleasantly enough and she was not at all surprisedat the end of it to have their walking party joined by boththe miss musgroves at mary's particular invitationchapter 6anne had not wanted this visit to uppercross to learn that a removalfrom one set of people to another though at a distance of only three mileswill often include a total change of conversation opinion and ideashe had never been staying there before without being struck by itor without wishing that other elliots could have her advantagein seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairswhich at kellynch hall were treated as of such general publicityand pervading interest yet with all this experience she believedshe must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowingour own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for herfor certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subjectwhich had been completely occupying both houses in kellynch for many weeksshe had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she foundin the separate but very similar remark of mr and mrs musgroveso miss anne sir walter and your sister are gone and what part of bathdo you think they will settle in and this without muchwaiting for an answer or in the young ladies' addition ofi hope we shall be in bath in the winter but remember papaif we do go we must be in a good situation  none of yourqueen squares for us! or in the anxious supplement from mary of--upon my word i shall be pretty well off when you are all gone awayto be happy at bath!she could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in futureand think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessingof having one such truly sympathising friend as lady russellthe mr musgroves had their own game to guard and to destroytheir own horses dogs and newspapers to engage them and the femaleswere fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeepingneighbours dress dancing and music  she acknowledged it to bevery fitting that every little social commonwealth should dictateits own matters of discourse and hoped ere long to becomea not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted intowith the prospect of spending at least two months at uppercrossit was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination her memoryand all her ideas in as much of uppercross as possibleshe had no dread of these two months  mary was not so repulsiveand unsisterly as elizabeth nor so inaccessible to all influence of hersneither was there anything among the other component partsof the cottage inimical to comfort  she was always on friendly termswith her brother-in-law and in the children who loved her nearly as welland respected her a great deal more than their mother she hadan object of interest amusement and wholesome exertioncharles musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he wasundoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversationor grace to make the past as they were connected togetherat all a dangerous contemplation though at the same timeanne could believe with lady russell that a more equal matchmight have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understandingmight have given more consequence to his character and more usefulnessrationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits  as it washe did nothing with much zeal but sport and his time was otherwisetrifled away without benefit from books or anything elsehe had very good spirits which never seemed much affected byhis wife's occasional lowness bore with her unreasonablenesssometimes to anne's admiration and upon the whole though there wasvery often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more sharethan she wished being appealed to by both parties they might passfor a happy couple  they were always perfectly agreed in the wantof more money and a strong inclination for a handsome presentfrom his father but here as on most topics he had the superiorityfor while mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not madehe always contended for his father's having many other uses for his moneyand a right to spend it as he likedas to the management of their children his theory was much betterthan his wife's and his practice not so bad  i could manage themvery well if it were not for mary's interference was whatanne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith inbut when listening in turn to mary's reproach of charles spoilsthe children so that i cannot get them into any order she never hadthe smallest temptation to say very trueone of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence therewas her being treated with too much confidence by all partiesand being too much in the secret of the complaints of each houseknown to have some influence with her sister she was continually requestedor at least receiving hints to exert it beyond what was practicablei wish you could persuade mary not to be always fancying herself illwas charles's language and in an unhappy mood thus spoke maryi do believe if charles were to see me dying he would not thinkthere was anything the matter with me  i am sure anne if you wouldyou might persuade him that i really am very ill--a great deal worsethan i ever ownmary's declaration was i hate sending the children to the great housethough their grandmamma is always wanting to see them for she humoursand indulges them to such a degree and gives them so much trashand sweet things that they are sure to come back sick and crossfor the rest of the day  and mrs musgrove took the first opportunityof being alone with anne to say oh! miss anne i cannot help wishingmrs charles had a little of your method with those childrenthey are quite different creatures with you!  but to be surein general they are so spoilt!  it is a pity you cannot put your sisterin the way of managing them  they are as fine healthy childrenas ever were seen poor little dears! without partialitybut mrs charles knows no more how they should be treated--!bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes  i assure you miss anneit prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often asi otherwise should  i believe mrs charles is not quite pleasedwith my not inviting them oftener but you know it is very badto have children with one that one is obligated to be checkingevery moment don't do this and don't do that  or that one canonly keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for themshe had this communication moreover from mary  mrs musgrove thinksall her servants so steady that it would be high treasonto call it in question but i am sure without exaggerationthat her upper house-maid and laundry-maid instead of beingin their business are gadding about the village all day longi meet them wherever i go and i declare i never go twice into my nurserywithout seeing something of them  if jemima were not the trustieststeadiest creature in the world it would be enough to spoil herfor she tells me they are always tempting her to take a walk with themand on mrs musgrove's side it was i make a rule of never interferingin any of my daughter-in-law's concerns for i know it would not dobut i shall tell you miss anne because you may be able to set thingsto rights that i have no very good opinion of mrs charles's nursery-maidi hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and frommy own knowledge i can declare she is such a fine-dressing ladythat she is enough to ruin any servants she comes nearmrs charles quite swears by her i know but i just give you this hintthat you may be upon the watch because if you see anything amissyou need not be afraid of mentioning itagain it was mary's complaint that mrs musgrove was very aptnot to give her the precedence that was her due when they dinedat the great house with other families and she did not see any reasonwhy she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her placeand one day when anne was walking with only the musgroves one of themafter talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank saidi have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons areabout their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferentyou are about it but i wish anybody could give mary a hint thatit would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenaciousespecially if she would not be always putting herself forward to takeplace of mamma  nobody doubts her right to have precedence of mammabut it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on itit is not that mamma cares about it the least in the worldbut i know it is taken notice of by many personshow was anne to set all these matters to rights  she could do little morethan listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse eachto the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessarybetween such near neighbours and make those hints broadestwhich were meant for her sister's benefitin all other respects her visit began and proceeded very wellher own spirits improved by change of place and subjectby being removed three miles from kellynch mary's ailments lessenedby having a constant companion and their daily intercoursewith the other family since there was neither superior affectionconfidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by itwas rather an advantage  it was certainly carried nearly as far as possiblefor they met every morning and hardly ever spent an evening asunderbut she believed they should not have done so well without the sightof mr and mrs musgrove's respectable forms in the usual placesor without the talking laughing and singing of their daughtersshe played a great deal better than either of the miss musgrovesbut having no voice no knowledge of the harp and no fond parentsto sit by and fancy themselves delighted her performance waslittle thought of only out of civility or to refresh the othersas she was well aware  she knew that when she played she wasgiving pleasure only to herself but this was no new sensationexcepting one short period of her life she had never since the ageof fourteen never since the loss of her dear mother known the happinessof being listened to or encouraged by any just appreciation or real tastein music she had been always used to feel alone in the worldand mr and mrs musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters'performance and total indifference to any other person'sgave her much more pleasure for their sakes than mortificationfor her ownthe party at the great house was sometimes increased by other companythe neighbourhood was not large but the musgroves were visitedby everybody and had more dinner-parties and more callersmore visitors by invitation and by chance than any other familythere were more completely popularthe girls were wild for dancing and the evenings ended occasionallyin an unpremeditated little ball  there was a family of cousinswithin a walk of uppercross in less affluent circumstanceswho depended on the musgroves for all their pleasures  they would comeat any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and annevery much preferring the office of musician to a more active postplayed country dances to them by the hour together a kindness whichalways recommended her musical powers to the notice of mr and mrs musgrovemore than anything else and often drew this compliment--well done miss anne! very well done indeed!  lord bless me!how those little fingers of yours fly about!so passed the first three weeks  michaelmas came and now anne's heartmust be in kellynch again  a beloved home made over to othersall the precious rooms and furniture groves and prospectsbeginning to own other eyes and other limbs!  she could notthink of much else on the 29th of september and she had thissympathetic touch in the evening from mary who on having occasionto note down the day of the month exclaimed dear me is not thisthe day the crofts were to come to kellynch  i am glad i did notthink of it before  how low it makes me!the crofts took possession with true naval alertness and wereto be visited  mary deplored the necessity for herselfnobody knew how much she should suffer  she should put it offas long as she could but was not easy till she had talked charlesinto driving her over on an early day and was in a very animatedcomfortable state of imaginary agitation when she came backanne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her goingshe wished however to see the crofts and was glad to be withinwhen the visit was returned  they came  the master of the housewas not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chancedthat mrs croft fell to the share of anne while the admiral sat by maryand made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured noticeof her little boys she was well able to watch for a likenessand if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voiceor in the turn of sentiment and expressionmrs croft though neither tall nor fat had a squarenessuprightness and vigour of form which gave importance to her personshe had bright dark eyes good teeth and altogether an agreeable facethough her reddened and weather-beaten complexion the consequenceof her having been almost as much at sea as her husband made her seem tohave lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirtyher manners were open easy and decided like one who hadno distrust of herself and no doubts of what to do without anyapproach to coarseness however or any want of good humouranne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great considerationtowards herself in all that related to kellynch and it pleased herespecially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minutein the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallestsymptom of any knowledge or suspicion on mrs croft's side to give a biasof any sort  she was quite easy on that head and consequentlyfull of strength and courage till for a moment electrified bymrs croft's suddenly saying--it was you and not your sister i find that my brother hadthe pleasure of being acquainted with when he was in this countryanne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotionshe certainly had notperhaps you may not have heard that he is married added mrs croftshe could now answer as she ought and was happy to feelwhen mrs croft's next words explained it to be mr wentworthof whom she spoke that she had said nothing which might not dofor either brother she immediately felt how reasonable it wasthat mrs croft should be thinking and speaking of edwardand not of frederick and with shame at her own forgetfulnessapplied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour'spresent state with proper interestthe rest was all tranquillity till just as they were movingshe heard the admiral say to mary--we are expecting a brother of mrs croft's here soon i dare sayyou know him by namehe was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boysclinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not goand being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them awayin his coat pockets &c to have another moment for finishingor recollecting what he had begun anne was left to persuade herselfas well as she could that the same brother must still be in questionshe could not however reach such a degree of certaintyas not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subjectat the other house where the crofts had previously been callingthe folks of the great house were to spend the evening of this dayat the cottage and it being now too late in the year for such visitsto be made on foot the coach was beginning to be listened forwhen the youngest miss musgrove walked in  that she was comingto apologize and that they should have to spend the evening by themselveswas the first black idea and mary was quite ready to be affrontedwhen louisa made all right by saying that she only came on footto leave more room for the harp which was bringing in the carriageand i will tell you our reason she added and all about iti am come on to give you notice that papa and mamma areout of spirits this evening especially mamma she is thinking so muchof poor richard!  and we agreed it would be best to have the harpfor it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte  i will tell youwhy she is out of spirits  when the crofts called this morningthey called here afterwards did not they they happened to saythat her brother captain wentworth is just returned to englandor paid off or something and is coming to see them almost directlyand most unluckily it came into mamma's head when they were gonethat wentworth or something very like it was the name ofpoor richard's captain at one time i do not know when or wherebut a great while before he died poor fellow!  and upon looking overhis letters and things she found it was so and is perfectly surethat this must be the very man and her head is quite full of itand of poor richard!  so we must be as merry as we can that she may notbe dwelling upon such gloomy thingsthe real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history werethat the musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesomehopeless son and the good fortune to lose him before he reachedhis twentieth year that he had been sent to sea because he was stupidand unmanageable on shore that he had been very little cared forat any time by his family though quite as much as he deservedseldom heard of and scarcely at all regretted when the intelligenceof his death abroad had worked its way to uppercross two years beforehe had in fact though his sisters were now doing all they could for himby calling him poor richard been nothing better than a thick-headedunfeeling unprofitable dick musgrove who had never done anythingto entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his nameliving or deadhe had been several years at sea and had in the course of those removalsto which all midshipmen are liable and especially such midshipmenas every captain wishes to get rid of been six months on boardcaptain frederick wentworth's frigate the laconia and from the laconiahe had under the influence of his captain written the only two letterswhich his father and mother had ever received from him during the wholeof his absence that is to say the only two disinterested lettersall the rest had been mere applications for moneyin each letter he had spoken well of his captain but yetso little were they in the habit of attending to such mattersso unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or shipsthat it had made scarcely any impression at the time and that mrs musgroveshould have been suddenly struck this very day with a recollectionof the name of wentworth as connected with her son seemed one of thoseextraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occurshe had gone to her letters and found it all as she supposedand the re-perusal of these letters after so long an intervalher poor son gone for ever and all the strength of his faults forgottenhad affected her spirits exceedingly and thrown her intogreater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his deathmr musgrove was in a lesser degree affected likewise and whenthey reached the cottage they were evidently in want firstof being listened to anew on this subject and afterwardsof all the relief which cheerful companions could give themto hear them talking so much of captain wentworth repeating his nameso often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it mightthat it probably would turn out to be the very same captain wentworthwhom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming backfrom clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whetherit was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to anne's nervesshe found however that it was one to which she must inure herselfsince he actually was expected in the country she must teach herselfto be insensible on such points  and not only did it appear thathe was expected and speedily but the musgroves in their warm gratitudefor the kindness he had shewn poor dick and very high respectfor his character stamped as it was by poor dick's having beensix months under his care and mentioning him in strongthough not perfectly well-spelt praise as a fine dashing felowonly two perticular about the schoolmaster were bent onintroducing themselves and seeking his acquaintance as soon asthey could hear of his arrivalthe resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their eveningchapter 7a very few days more and captain wentworth was known to be at kellynchand mr musgrove had called on him and come back warm in his praiseand he was engaged with the crofts to dine at uppercrossby the end of another week  it had been a great disappointmentto mr musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixedso impatient was he to shew his gratitude by seeing captain wentworthunder his own roof and welcoming him to all that was strongestand best in his cellars  but a week must pass only a weekin anne's reckoning and then she supposed they must meetand soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a weekcaptain wentworth made a very early return to mr musgrove's civilityand she was all but calling there in the same half hourshe and mary were actually setting forward for the great housewhere as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found himwhen they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that momentbrought home in consequence of a bad fall  the child's situationput the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escapewith indifference even in the midst of the serious anxietywhich they afterwards felt on his accounthis collar-bone was found to be dislocated and such injuryreceived in the back as roused the most alarming ideasit was an afternoon of distress and anne had every thing to do at oncethe apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informedthe mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to controlthe youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attendand soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected itproper notice to the other house which brought her an accessionrather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistantsher brother's return was the first comfort he could take best careof his wife and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecarytill he came and had examined the child their apprehensions werethe worse for being vague they suspected great injury but knew not wherebut now the collar-bone was soon replaced and though mr robinsonfelt and felt and rubbed and looked grave and spoke low wordsboth to the father and the aunt still they were all to hope the bestand to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mindand then it was just before they parted that the two young auntswere able so far to digress from their nephew's state as to givethe information of captain wentworth's visit staying five minutes behindtheir father and mother to endeavour to express how perfectly delightedthey were with him how much handsomer how infinitely more agreeablethey thought him than any individual among their male acquaintancewho had been at all a favourite before  how glad they had beento hear papa invite him to stay dinner how sorry when he saidit was quite out of his power and how glad again when he had promisedin reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to comeand dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrowand he had promised it in so pleasant a manner as if he feltall the motive of their attention just as he ought  and in shorthe had looked and said everything with such exquisite gracethat they could assure them all their heads were both turned by himand off they ran quite as full of glee as of love and apparentlymore full of captain wentworth than of little charlesthe same story and the same raptures were repeated when the two girls camewith their father through the gloom of the evening to make enquiriesand mr musgrove no longer under the first uneasiness about his heircould add his confirmation and praise and hope there would be nowno occasion for putting captain wentworth off and only be sorry to thinkthat the cottage party probably would not like to leave the little boyto give him the meeting  oh no as to leaving the little boyboth father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarmto bear the thought and anne in the joy of the escapecould not help adding her warm protestations to theirscharles musgrove indeed afterwards shewed more of inclinationthe child was going on so well and he wished so much to be introducedto captain wentworth that perhaps he might join them in the eveninghe would not dine from home but he might walk in for half an hourbut in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife with oh! no indeedcharles i cannot bear to have you go away  only think if anythingshould happenthe child had a good night and was going on well the next dayit must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had beendone to the spine but mr robinson found nothing to increase alarmand charles musgrove began consequently to feel no necessityfor longer confinement  the child was to be kept in bed and amusedas quietly as possible but what was there for a father to dothis was quite a female case and it would be highly absurd in himwho could be of no use at home to shut himself up  his fathervery much wished him to meet captain wentworth and there beingno sufficient reason against it he ought to go and it ended in hismaking a bold public declaration when he came in from shootingof his meaning to dress directly and dine at the other housenothing can be going on better than the child said heso i told my father just now that i would come and he thought mequite right  your sister being with you my love i have no scruple at allyou would not like to leave him yourself but you see i can be of no useanne will send for me if anything is the matterhusbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vainmary knew from charles's manner of speaking that he wasquite determined on going and that it would be of no use to teaze himshe said nothing therefore till he was out of the roombut as soon as there was only anne to hear--so you and i are to be left to shift by ourselves with thispoor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening!i knew how it would be  this is always my luck  if there isanything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of itand charles is as bad as any of them  very unfeeling!  i must sayit is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little boytalks of his being going on so well!  how does he know that he isgoing on well or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hencei did not think charles would have been so unfeeling  so here he is togo away and enjoy himself and because i am the poor motheri am not to be allowed to stir and yet i am sure i am more unfitthan anybody else to be about the child  my being the motheris the very reason why my feelings should not be tried  i am not at allequal to it  you saw how hysterical i was yesterdaybut that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the shock  you will not be hysterical again  i dare say we shall havenothing to distress us  i perfectly understand mr robinson's directionsand have no fears and indeed mary i cannot wonder at your husbandnursing does not belong to a man it is not his provincea sick child is always the mother's property  her own feelingsgenerally make it soi hope i am as fond of my child as any mother but i do not knowthat i am of any more use in the sick-room than charlesfor i cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is illand you saw this morning that if i told him to keep quiethe was sure to begin kicking about  i have not nervesfor the sort of thingbut could you be comfortable yourself to be spendingthe whole evening away from the poor boyyes you see his papa can and why should not i  jemima is so carefuland she could send us word every hour how he was  i really thinkcharles might as well have told his father we would all comei am not more alarmed about little charles now than he isi was dreadfully alarmed yesterday but the case is very different to-daywell if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourselfsuppose you were to go as well as your husband  leave little charlesto my care  mr and mrs musgrove cannot think it wrong while i remainwith himare you serious cried mary her eyes brightening  dear me!that's a very good thought very good indeed  to be surei may just as well go as not for i am of no use at home--am iand it only harasses me  you who have not a mother's feelingsare a great deal the properest person  you can make little charlesdo anything he always minds you at a word  it will be a great deal betterthan leaving him only with jemima  oh! i shall certainly goi am sure i ought if i can quite as much as charles for they want meexcessively to be acquainted with captain wentworth and i knowyou do not mind being left alone  an excellent thought of yoursindeed anne  i will go and tell charles and get ready directlyyou can send for us you know at a moment's notice if anythingis the matter but i dare say there will be nothing to alarm youi should not go you may be sure if i did not feel quite at easeabout my dear childthe next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room doorand as anne followed her up stairs she was in time forthe whole conversation which began with mary's sayingin a tone of great exultation--i mean to go with you charles for i am of no more use at homethan you are  if i were to shut myself up for ever with the childi should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not likeanne will stay anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of himit is anne's own proposal and so i shall go with you which will bea great deal better for i have not dined at the other house since tuesdaythis is very kind of anne was her husband's answer and i should bevery glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should beleft at home by herself to nurse our sick childanne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerityof her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where convictionwas at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her beingleft to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the eveningwhen the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged herto let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadableand this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing themset off together in high spirits  they were gone she hopedto be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seemas for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfortas were perhaps ever likely to be hers  she knew herself to beof the first utility to the child and what was it to herif frederick wentworth were only half a mile distant making himselfagreeable to othersshe would have liked to know how he felt as to a meetingperhaps indifferent if indifference could exist under such circumstanceshe must be either indifferent or unwilling  had he wishedever to see her again he need not have waited till this timehe would have done what she could not but believe that in his placeshe should have done long ago when events had been early giving himthe independence which alone had been wantingher brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintanceand their visit in general  there had been music singingtalking laughing all that was most agreeable charming mannersin captain wentworth no shyness or reserve they seemed allto know each other perfectly and he was coming the very next morningto shoot with charles  he was to come to breakfast but not at the cottagethough that had been proposed at first but then he had been pressedto come to the great house instead and he seemed afraid of beingin mrs charles musgrove's way on account of the child and thereforesomehow they hardly knew how it ended in charles's being to meet himto breakfast at his father'sanne understood it  he wished to avoid seeing her  he had inquiredafter her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintanceseeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhapsby the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meetthe morning hours of the cottage were always later than thoseof the other house and on the morrow the difference was so greatthat mary and anne were not more than beginning breakfast whencharles came in to say that they were just setting off that he wascome for his dogs that his sisters were following with captain wentworthhis sisters meaning to visit mary and the child and captain wentworthproposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenientand though charles had answered for the child's being in no such stateas could make it inconvenient captain wentworth would not be satisfiedwithout his running on to give noticemary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive himwhile a thousand feelings rushed on anne of which this wasthe most consoling that it would soon be over  and it was soon overin two minutes after charles's preparation the others appearedthey were in the drawing-room  her eye half met captain wentworth'sa bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to marysaid all that was right said something to the miss musgrovesenough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of personsand voices but a few minutes ended it  charles shewed himselfat the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gonethe miss musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walkto the end of the village with the sportsmen  the room was clearedand anne might finish her breakfast as she couldit is over! it is over! she repeated to herself again and againin nervous gratitude  the worst is over!mary talked but she could not attend  she had seen himthey had met  they had been once more in the same roomsoon however she began to reason with herself and try to be feeling lesseight years almost eight years had passed since all had been given uphow absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an intervalhad banished into distance and indistinctness!  what might noteight years do  events of every description changes alienationsremovals--all all must be comprised in it and oblivion of the past--how natural how certain too!  it included nearly a third partof her own lifealas! with all her reasoning she found that to retentive feelingseight years may be little more than nothingnow how were his sentiments to be read  was this likewishing to avoid her  and the next moment she was hating herselffor the folly which asked the questionon one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdommight not have prevented she was soon spared all suspensefor after the miss musgroves had returned and finished their visitat the cottage she had this spontaneous information from mary --captain wentworth is not very gallant by you anne though he wasso attentive to me  henrietta asked him what he thought of youwhen they went away and he said `you were so altered he should nothave known you again'mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common waybut she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar woundaltered beyond his knowledge  anne fully submitted in silentdeep mortification  doubtless it was so and she could take no revengefor he was not altered or not for the worse  she had alreadyacknowledged it to herself and she could not think differentlylet him think of her as he would  no  the years which had destroyedher youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manlyopen look in no respect lessening his personal advantagesshe had seen the same frederick wentworthso altered that he should not have known her again!  these were wordswhich could not but dwell with her  yet she soon began to rejoicethat she had heard them  they were of sobering tendencythey allayed agitation they composed and consequently mustmake her happierfrederick wentworth had used such words or something like thembut without an idea that they would be carried round to herhe had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appealhad spoken as he felt  he had not forgiven anne elliotshe had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worseshe had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decidedconfident temper could not endure  she had given him up to oblige othersit had been the effect of over-persuasion  it had beenweakness and timidityhe had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman sincewhom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensationof curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again  her power with himwas gone for everit was now his object to marry  he was rich and being turned on shorefully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly temptedactually looking round ready to fall in love with all the speedwhich a clear head and a quick taste could allow  he had a heartfor either of the miss musgroves if they could catch it a heartin short for any pleasing young woman who came in his wayexcepting anne elliot  this was his only secret exceptionwhen he said to his sister in answer to her suppositions--yes here i am sophia quite ready to make a foolish matchanybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for askinga little beauty and a few smiles and a few compliments to the navyand i am a lost man  should not this be enough for a sailorwho has had no society among women to make him nicehe said it she knew to be contradicted  his bright proud eyespoke the conviction that he was nice and anne elliot wasnot out of his thoughts when he more seriously describedthe woman he should wish to meet with  a strong mindwith sweetness of manner made the first and the last of the descriptionthat is the woman i want said he  something a little inferiori shall of course put up with but it must not be much  if i am a fooli shall be a fool indeed for i have thought on the subjectmore than most menchapter 8from this time captain wentworth and anne elliot were repeatedlyin the same circle  they were soon dining in company togetherat mr musgrove's for the little boy's state could no longersupply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself and this wasbut the beginning of other dinings and other meetingswhether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proofformer times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of eachthey could not but be reverted to the year of their engagementcould not but be named by him in the little narratives or descriptionswhich conversation called forth  his profession qualified himhis disposition lead him to talk and that was in the year sixthat happened before i went to sea in the year six occurredin the course of the first evening they spent togetherand though his voice did not falter and though she had no reasonto suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spokeanne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mindthat he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herselfthere must be the same immediate association of thoughtthough she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal painthey had no conversation together no intercourse but whatthe commonest civility required  once so much to each other!now nothing!  there had been a time when of all the large partynow filling the drawing-room at uppercross they would have found itmost difficult to cease to speak to one another  with the exceptionperhaps of admiral and mrs croft who seemed particularly attachedand happy anne could allow no other exceptions even amongthe married couples there could have been no two hearts so openno tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so belovednow they were as strangers nay worse than strangers for they couldnever become acquainted  it was a perpetual estrangementwhen he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mindthere was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the partyand he was very much questioned and especially by the two miss musgroveswho seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the mannerof living on board daily regulations food hours &c and their surpriseat his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangementwhich was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridiculewhich reminded anne of the early days when she too had been ignorantand she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on boardwithout anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there wereor any servant to wait or any knife and fork to usefrom thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisperof mrs musgrove's who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying--ah! miss anne if it had pleased heaven to spare my poor soni dare say he would have been just such another by this timeanne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while mrs musgroverelieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes thereforecould not keep pace with the conversation of the otherswhen she could let her attention take its natural course againshe found the miss musgroves just fetching the navy listtheir own navy list the first that had ever been at uppercrossand sitting down together to pore over it with the professed viewof finding out the ships that captain wentworth had commandedyour first was the asp i remember we will look for the aspyou will not find her there  quite worn out and broken upi was the last man who commanded her  hardly fit for service thenreported fit for home service for a year or two and so i was sent offto the west indiesthe girls looked all amazementthe admiralty he continued entertain themselves now and thenwith sending a few hundred men to sea in a ship not fit to be employedbut they have a great many to provide for and among the thousandsthat may just as well go to the bottom as not it is impossiblefor them to distinguish the very set who may be least missedphoo! phoo! cried the admiral what stuff these young fellows talk!never was a better sloop than the asp in her day  for an old built sloopyou would not see her equal  lucky fellow to get her!  he knows theremust have been twenty better men than himself applying for herat the same time  lucky fellow to get anything so soonwith no more interest than hisi felt my luck admiral i assure you replied captain wentworthseriously  i was as well satisfied with my appointment as you can desireit was a great object with me at that time to be at seaa very great object i wanted to be doing somethingto be sure you did  what should a young fellow like you do ashorefor half a year together  if a man had not a wife he soon wantsto be afloat againbut captain wentworth cried louisa how vexed you must have beenwhen you came to the asp to see what an old thing they had given youi knew pretty well what she was before that day said he smilingi had no more discoveries to make than you would have as tothe fashion and strength of any old pelisse which you had seenlent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could rememberand which at last on some very wet day is lent to yourselfah! she was a dear old asp to me  she did all that i wantedi knew she would  i knew that we should either go to the bottom togetheror that she would be the making of me and i never had two daysof foul weather all the time i was at sea in her and aftertaking privateers enough to be very entertaining i had the good luckin my passage home the next autumn to fall in with the very french frigatei wanted  i brought her into plymouth and here another instance of luckwe had not been six hours in the sound when a gale came onwhich lasted four days and nights and which would have done forpoor old asp in half the time our touch with the great nationnot having much improved our condition  four-and-twenty hours laterand i should only have been a gallant captain wentworthin a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers and being lostin only a sloop nobody would have thought about me anne's shudderingswere to herself alone but the miss musgroves could be as openas they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horrorand so then i suppose said mrs musgrove in a low voiceas if thinking aloud so then he went away to the laconia and therehe met with our poor boy charles my dear beckoning him to herdo ask captain wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brotheri always forgotit was at gibraltar mother i know  dick had been left ill at gibraltarwith a recommendation from his former captain to captain wentworthoh! but charles tell captain wentworth he need not be afraidof mentioning poor dick before me for it would be rather a pleasureto hear him talked of by such a good friendcharles being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the caseonly nodded in reply and walked awaythe girls were now hunting for the laconia and captain wentworthcould not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volumeinto his own hands to save them the trouble and once more read aloudthe little statement of her name and rate and presentnon-commissioned class observing over it that she too had beenone of the best friends man ever hadah! those were pleasant days when i had the laconia!  how fast imade money in her  a friend of mine and i had such a lovely cruisetogether off the western islands  poor harville sister!you know how much he wanted money  worse than myself  he had a wifeexcellent fellow  i shall never forget his happiness  he felt it allso much for her sake  i wished for him again the next summerwhen i had still the same luck in the mediterraneanand i am sure sir said mrs musgrove it was a lucky day for uswhen you were put captain into that ship  we shall never forgetwhat you didher feelings made her speak low and captain wentworthhearing only in part and probably not having dick musgrove at allnear his thoughts looked rather in suspense and as if waiting for moremy brother whispered one of the girls mamma is thinkingof poor richardpoor dear fellow! continued mrs musgrove he was grown so steadyand such an excellent correspondent while he was under your care!ah! it would have been a happy thing if he had never left youi assure you captain wentworth we are very sorry he ever left youthere was a momentary expression in captain wentworth's face at this speecha certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouthwhich convinced anne that instead of sharing in mrs musgrove's kind wishesas to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of himbut it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detectedby any who understood him less than herself in another momenthe was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwardscoming up to the sofa on which she and mrs musgrove were sittingtook a place by the latter and entered into conversation with herin a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathyand natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for allthat was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelingsthey were actually on the same sofa for mrs musgrove hadmost readily made room for him they were divided only by mrs musgroveit was no insignificant barrier indeed  mrs musgrove was ofa comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by natureto express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentimentand while the agitations of anne's slender form and pensive facemay be considered as very completely screened captain wentworthshould be allowed some credit for the self-command with whichhe attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a sonwhom alive nobody had cared forpersonal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportionsa large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep afflictionas the most graceful set of limbs in the world  but fair or not fairthere are unbecoming conjunctions which reason will patronize in vain--which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seizethe admiral after taking two or three refreshing turns about the roomwith his hands behind him being called to order by his wifenow came up to captain wentworth and without any observationof what he might be interrupting thinking only of his own thoughtsbegan with--if you had been a week later at lisbon last spring frederickyou would have been asked to give a passage to lady mary griersonand her daughtersshould i  i am glad i was not a week later thenthe admiral abused him for his want of gallantry  he defended himselfthough professing that he would never willingly admit any ladieson board a ship of his excepting for a ball or a visitwhich a few hours might comprehendbut if i know myself said he this is from no want of gallantrytowards them  it is rather from feeling how impossible it iswith all one's efforts and all one's sacrifices to makethe accommodations on board such as women ought to havethere can be no want of gallantry admiral in rating the claims of womento every personal comfort high and this is what i do  i hate to hearof women on board or to see them on board and no ship under my commandshall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere if i can help itthis brought his sister upon himoh! frederick!  but i cannot believe it of you --all idle refinement!--women may be as comfortable on board as in the best house in englandi believe i have lived as much on board as most women and i knownothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war  i declarei have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at kellynch hallwith a kind bow to anne beyond what i always had in most ofthe ships i have lived in and they have been five altogethernothing to the purpose replied her brother  you were livingwith your husband and were the only woman on boardbut you yourself brought mrs harville her sister her cousinand three children round from portsmouth to plymouth  where was thissuperfine extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours thenall merged in my friendship sophia  i would assist anybrother officer's wife that i could and i would bring anythingof harville's from the world's end if he wanted it  but do not imaginethat i did not feel it an evil in itselfdepend upon it they were all perfectly comfortablei might not like them the better for that perhaps  such a numberof women and children have no right to be comfortable on boardmy dear frederick you are talking quite idly  pray what wouldbecome of us poor sailors' wives who often want to be conveyed toone port or another after our husbands if everybody had your feelingsmy feelings you see did not prevent my taking mrs harvilleand all her family to plymouthbut i hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentlemanand as if women were all fine ladies instead of rational creatureswe none of us expect to be in smooth water all our daysah! my dear said the admiral when he had got a wifehe will sing a different tune  when he is married if we havethe good luck to live to another war we shall see him do as you and iand a great many others have done  we shall have him very thankfulto anybody that will bring him his wifeay that we shallnow i have done cried captain wentworth  when once marriedpeople begin to attack me with--`oh! you will think very differentlywhen you are married'  i can only say `no i shall not' and thenthey say again `yes you will' and there is an end of ithe got up and moved awaywhat a great traveller you must have been ma'am! said mrs musgroveto mrs croftpretty well ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriagethough many women have done more  i have crossed the atlanticfour times and have been once to the east indies and back againand only once besides being in different places about homecork and lisbon and gibraltar  but i never went beyond the streightsand never was in the west indies  we do not call bermuda or bahamayou know the west indiesmrs musgrove had not a word to say in dissent she could not accuse herselfof having ever called them anything in the whole course of her lifeand i do assure you ma'am pursued mrs croft that nothing can exceedthe accommodations of a man-of-war i speak you know of the higher rateswhen you come to a frigate of course you are more confinedthough any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of themand i can safely say that the happiest part of my life has been spenton board a ship  while we were together you know there was nothingto be feared  thank god!  i have always been blessed withexcellent health and no climate disagrees with me  a little disorderedalways the first twenty-four hours of going to sea but never knewwhat sickness was afterwards  the only time i ever really sufferedin body or mind the only time that i ever fancied myself unwellor had any ideas of danger was the winter that i passed by myself at dealwhen the admiral captain croft then was in the north seasi lived in perpetual fright at that time and had all manner ofimaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myselfor when i should hear from him next but as long as we could be togethernothing ever ailed me and i never met with the smallest inconvenienceaye to be sure  yes indeed oh yes!  i am quite of your opinionmrs croft was mrs musgrove's hearty answer  there is nothing so badas a separation  i am quite of your opinion  i know what it isfor mr musgrove always attends the assizes and i am so glad whenthey are over and he is safe back againthe evening ended with dancing  on its being proposedanne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimesfill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely gladto be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobservedit was a merry joyous party and no one seemed in higher spiritsthan captain wentworth  she felt that he had every thing to elevatehim which general attention and deference and especially the attentionof all the young women could do  the miss hayters the femalesof the family of cousins already mentioned were apparently admittedto the honour of being in love with him and as for henrietta and louisathey both seemed so entirely occupied by him that nothing butthe continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselvescould have made it credible that they were not decided rivalsif he were a little spoilt by such universal such eager admirationwho could wonderthese were some of the thoughts which occupied anne while her fingerswere mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour togetherequally without error and without consciousness  once she feltthat he was looking at herself  observing her altered featuresperhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had oncecharmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of hershe was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she wassure of his having asked his partner whether miss elliot never dancedthe answer was oh no never she has quite given up dancingshe had rather play  she is never tired of playing  once toohe spoke to her  she had left the instrument on the dancing being overand he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wishedto give the miss musgroves an idea of  unintentionally she returnedto that part of the room he saw her and instantly risingsaid with studied politeness--i beg your pardon madam this is your seat and though she immediatelydrew back with a decided negative he was not to be inducedto sit down againanne did not wish for more of such looks and speecheshis cold politeness his ceremonious grace were worse than anythingchapter 9captain wentworth was come to kellynch as to a home to stayas long as he liked being as thoroughly the object ofthe admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's  he had intendedon first arriving to proceed very soon into shropshireand visit the brother settled in that country but the attractionsof uppercross induced him to put this off  there was so muchof friendliness and of flattery and of everything most bewitchingin his reception there the old were so hospitable the young so agreeablethat he could not but resolve to remain where he was and take allthe charms and perfections of edward's wife upon credit a little longerit was soon uppercross with him almost every day  the musgrovescould hardly be more ready to invite than he to come particularlyin the morning when he had no companion at home for the admiraland mrs croft were generally out of doors together interesting themselvesin their new possessions their grass and their sheep and dawdling aboutin a way not endurable to a third person or driving out in a giglately added to their establishmenthitherto there had been but one opinion of captain wentworthamong the musgroves and their dependencies  it was unvaryingwarm admiration everywhere but this intimate footing was not morethan established when a certain charles hayter returned among themto be a good deal disturbed by it and to think captain wentworthvery much in the waycharles hayter was the eldest of all the cousins and a very amiablepleasing young man between whom and henrietta there had beena considerable appearance of attachment previous to captain wentworth'sintroduction  he was in orders and having a curacy in the neighbourhoodwhere residence was not required lived at his father's houseonly two miles from uppercross  a short absence from homehad left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical periodand when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered mannersand of seeing captain wentworthmrs musgrove and mrs hayter were sisters  they had each had moneybut their marriages had made a material difference intheir degree of consequence  mr hayter had some property of his ownbut it was insignificant compared with mr musgrove's and whilethe musgroves were in the first class of society in the countrythe young hayters would from their parents' inferior retiredand unpolished way of living and their own defective educationhave been hardly in any class at all but for their connexionwith uppercross this eldest son of course excepted who had chosento be a scholar and a gentleman and who was very superiorin cultivation and manners to all the restthe two families had always been on excellent terms there being no prideon one side and no envy on the other and only such a consciousnessof superiority in the miss musgroves as made them pleasedto improve their cousins  charles's attentions to henriettahad been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobationit would not be a great match for her but if henrietta liked him--and henrietta did seem to like himhenrietta fully thought so herself before captain wentworth camebut from that time cousin charles had been very much forgottenwhich of the two sisters was preferred by captain wentworth wasas yet quite doubtful as far as anne's observation reachedhenrietta was perhaps the prettiest louisa had the higher spiritsand she knew not now whether the more gentle or the more lively characterwere most likely to attract himmr and mrs musgrove either from seeing little or froman entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughtersand of all the young men who came near them seemed to leave everythingto take its chance  there was not the smallest appearance of solicitudeor remark about them in the mansion-house but it was differentat the cottage  the young couple there were more disposedto speculate and wonder and captain wentworth had not been abovefour or five times in the miss musgroves' company and charles hayterhad but just reappeared when anne had to listen to the opinionsof her brother and sister as to which was the one liked bestcharles gave it for louisa mary for henrietta but quite agreeingthat to have him marry either could be extremely delightfulcharles had never seen a pleasanter man in his life and from whathe had once heard captain wentworth himself say was very sure thathe had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the warhere was a fortune at once besides which there would be the chanceof what might be done in any future war and he was sure captain wentworthwas as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navyoh! it would be a capital match for either of his sistersupon my word it would replied mary  dear me!  if he shouldrise to any very great honours!  if he should ever be made a baronet!`lady wentworth' sounds very well  that would be a noble thingindeed for henrietta!  she would take place of me then and henriettawould not dislike that  sir frederick and lady wentworth!it would be but a new creation however and i never think muchof your new creationsit suited mary best to think henrietta the one preferredon the very account of charles hayter whose pretensions she wishedto see put an end to  she looked down very decidedly upon the haytersand thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connectionbetween the families renewed--very sad for herself and her childrenyou know said she i cannot think him at all a fit match for henriettaand considering the alliances which the musgroves have madeshe has no right to throw herself away  i do not think any young womanhas a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenientto the principal part of her family and be giving bad connectionsto those who have not been used to them  and pray who is charles hayternothing but a country curate  a most improper match for miss musgroveof uppercrossher husband however would not agree with her here for besides havinga regard for his cousin charles hayter was an eldest sonand he saw things as an eldest son himselfnow you are taking nonsense mary was therefore his answerit would not be a great match for henrietta but charles hasa very fair chance through the spicers of getting something fromthe bishop in the course of a year or two and you will please to rememberthat he is the eldest son whenever my uncle dies he steps into verypretty property  the estate at winthrop is not less thantwo hundred and fifty acres besides the farm near tauntonwhich is some of the best land in the country  i grant youthat any of them but charles would be a very shocking match for henriettaand indeed it could not be he is the only one that could be possiblebut he is a very good-natured good sort of a fellow and whenever winthropcomes into his hands he will make a different sort of place of itand live in a very different sort of way and with that propertyhe will never be a contemptible man--good freehold property  no nohenrietta might do worse than marry charles hayter and if she has himand louisa can get captain wentworth i shall be very well satisfiedcharles may say what he pleases cried mary to anne as soon ashe was out of the room but it would be shocking to have henriettamarry charles hayter a very bad thing for her and still worsefor me and therefore it is very much to be wished that captain wentworthmay soon put him quite out of her head and i have very little doubtthat he has  she took hardly any notice of charles hayter yesterdayi wish you had been there to see her behaviour  and as tocaptain wentworth's liking louisa as well as henrietta it is nonsenseto say so for he certainly does like henrietta a great deal the bestbut charles is so positive!  i wish you had been with us yesterdayfor then you might have decided between us and i am sure youwould have thought as i did unless you had been determinedto give it against mea dinner at mr musgrove's had been the occasion when all these thingsshould have been seen by anne but she had staid at homeunder the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some returnof indisposition in little charles  she had thought only of avoidingcaptain wentworth but an escape from being appealed to as umpirewas now added to the advantages of a quiet eveningas to captain wentworth's views she deemed it of more consequencethat he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangeringthe happiness of either sister or impeaching his own honourthan that he should prefer henrietta to louisa or louisa to henriettaeither of them would in all probability make him an affectionategood-humoured wife  with regard to charles hayter she had delicacywhich must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaningyoung woman and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferingsit occasioned but if henrietta found herself mistaken in the natureof her feelings the alternation could not be understood too sooncharles hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify himin his cousin's behaviour  she had too old a regard for himto be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguishevery past hope and leave him nothing to do but to keep awayfrom uppercross  but there was such a change as became very alarmingwhen such a man as captain wentworth was to be regarded asthe probable cause  he had been absent only two sundaysand when they parted had left her interested even to the heightof his wishes in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacyand obtaining that of uppercross instead  it had then seemed the objectnearest her heart that dr shirley the rector who for more thanforty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his officebut was now growing too infirm for many of them should be quite fixedon engaging a curate should make his curacy quite as goodas he could afford and should give charles hayter the promise of itthe advantage of his having to come only to uppercross instead of goingsix miles another way of his having in every respect a better curacyof his belonging to their dear dr shirley and of dear good dr shirley'sbeing relieved from the duty which he could no longer get throughwithout most injurious fatigue had been a great deal even to louisabut had been almost everything to henrietta  when he came back alas!the zeal of the business was gone by  louisa could not listen at allto his account of a conversation which he had just held with dr shirleyshe was at a window looking out for captain wentworth and even henriettahad at best only a divided attention to give and seemed to have forgottenall the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiationwell i am very glad indeed  but i always thought you would have iti always thought you sure  it did not appear to me that--in shortyou know dr shirley must have a curate and you had secured his promiseis he coming louisaone morning very soon after the dinner at the musgrovesat which anne had not been present captain wentworth walked intothe drawing-room at the cottage where were only herself and the littleinvalid charles who was lying on the sofathe surprise of finding himself almost alone with anne elliotdeprived his manners of their usual composure  he startedand could only say i thought the miss musgroves had been heremrs musgrove told me i should find them here before he walkedto the window to recollect himself and feel how he ought to behavethey are up stairs with my sister  they will be down in a few momentsi dare say had been anne's reply in all the confusion that was naturaland if the child had not called her to come and do something for himshe would have been out of the room the next moment and releasedcaptain wentworth as well as herselfhe continued at the window and after calmly and politely sayingi hope the little boy is better was silentshe was obliged to kneel down by the sofa and remain thereto satisfy her patient and thus they continued a few minuteswhen to her very great satisfaction she heard some other personcrossing the little vestibule  she hoped on turning her headto see the master of the house but it proved to be onemuch less calculated for making matters easy--charles hayterprobably not at all better pleased by the sight of captain wentworththan captain wentworth had been by the sight of anneshe only attempted to say how do you do  will you not sit downthe others will be here presentlycaptain wentworth however came from his window apparentlynot ill-disposed for conversation but charles hayter soon put an endto his attempts by seating himself near the table and taking upthe newspaper and captain wentworth returned to his windowanother minute brought another addition  the younger boya remarkable stout forward child of two years old having got the dooropened for him by some one without made his determined appearanceamong them and went straight to the sofa to see what was going onand put in his claim to anything good that might be giving awaythere being nothing to eat he could only have some playand as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brotherhe began to fasten himself upon her as she knelt in such a way thatbusy as she was about charles she could not shake him offshe spoke to him ordered entreated and insisted in vainonce she did contrive to push him away but the boy hadthe greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directlywalter said she get down this moment  you are extremely troublesomei am very angry with youwalter cried charles hayter why do you not do as you are biddo not you hear your aunt speak  come to me walter come tocousin charlesbut not a bit did walter stirin another moment however she found herself in the state ofbeing released from him some one was taking him from herthough he had bent down her head so much that his little sturdy handswere unfastened from around her neck and he was resolutely borne awaybefore she knew that captain wentworth had done ither sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechlessshe could not even thank him  she could only hang over little charleswith most disordered feelings  his kindness in stepping forwardto her relief the manner the silence in which it had passedthe little particulars of the circumstance with the conviction soonforced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the childthat he meant to avoid hearing her thanks and rather soughtto testify that her conversation was the last of his wantsproduced such a confusion of varying but very painful agitationas she could not recover from till enabled by the entrance of maryand the miss musgroves to make over her little patient to their caresand leave the room  she could not stay  it might have beenan opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--they were now altogether but she could stay for none of itit was evident that charles hayter was not well inclined towardscaptain wentworth  she had a strong impression of his having saidin a vext tone of voice after captain wentworth's interferenceyou ought to have minded me walter i told you not to teaze your auntand could comprehend his regretting that captain wentworth should dowhat he ought to have done himself  but neither charles hayter's feelingsnor anybody's feelings could interest her till she had a little betterarranged her own  she was ashamed of herself quite ashamedof being so nervous so overcome by such a trifle but so it wasand it required a long application of solitude and reflectionto recover herchapter 10other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occuranne had soon been in company with all the four together often enoughto have an opinion though too wise to acknowledge as much at homewhere she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wifefor while she considered louisa to be rather the favouriteshe could not but think as far as she might dare to judge from memoryand experience that captain wentworth was not in love with eitherthey were more in love with him yet there it was not loveit was a little fever of admiration but it might probably mustend in love with some  charles hayter seemed aware of being slightedand yet henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between themanne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were aboutand of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves toshe did not attribute guile to any  it was the highest satisfactionto her to believe captain wentworth not in the least awareof the pain he was occasioning  there was no triumph no pitiful triumphin his manner  he had probably never heard and never thought ofany claims of charles hayter  he was only wrong in acceptingthe attentions for accepting must be the word of two young women at onceafter a short struggle however charles hayter seemed to quit the fieldthree days had passed without his coming once to uppercrossa most decided change  he had even refused one regular invitation to dinnerand having been found on the occasion by mr musgrove with some large booksbefore him mr and mrs musgrove were sure all could not be rightand talked with grave faces of his studying himself to deathit was mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissalfrom henrietta and her husband lived under the constant dependenceof seeing him to-morrow  anne could only feel that charles hayterwas wiseone morning about this time charles musgrove and captain wentworthbeing gone a-shooting together as the sisters in the cottagewere sitting quietly at work they were visited at the windowby the sisters from the mansion-houseit was a very fine november day and the miss musgroves camethrough the little grounds and stopped for no other purpose than to saythat they were going to take a long walk and therefore concludedmary could not like to go with them and when mary immediately repliedwith some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker oh yesi should like to join you very much i am very fond of a long walkanne felt persuaded by the looks of the two girls that it was preciselywhat they did not wish and admired again the sort of necessitywhich the family habits seemed to produce of everything beingto be communicated and everything being to be done togetherhowever undesired and inconvenient  she tried to dissuade mary from goingbut in vain and that being the case thought it best to acceptthe miss musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewiseas she might be useful in turning back with her sister and lesseningthe interference in any plan of their owni cannot imagine why they should suppose i should not like a long walksaid mary as she went up stairs  everybody is always supposingthat i am not a good walker and yet they would not have been pleasedif we had refused to join them  when people come in this manneron purpose to ask us how can one say nojust as they were setting off the gentlemen returned  they had taken outa young dog who had spoilt their sport and sent them back earlytheir time and strength and spirits were therefore exactly readyfor this walk and they entered into it with pleasure  could annehave foreseen such a junction she would have staid at home butfrom some feelings of interest and curiosity she fancied now that it wastoo late to retract and the whole six set forward togetherin the direction chosen by the miss musgroves who evidentlyconsidered the walk as under their guidanceanne's object was not to be in the way of anybody and wherethe narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessaryto keep with her brother and sister  her pleasure in the walkmust arise from the exercise and the day from the view ofthe last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves and withered hedgesand from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poeticaldescriptions extant of autumn that season of peculiar andinexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tendernessthat season which had drawn from every poet worthy of being readsome attempt at description or some lines of feelingshe occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musingsand quotations but it was not possible that when within reachof captain wentworth's conversation with either of the miss musgrovesshe should not try to hear it yet she caught little very remarkableit was mere lively chat such as any young persons on an intimate footingmight fall into  he was more engaged with louisa than with henriettalouisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sisterthis distinction appeared to increase and there was one speechof louisa's which struck her  after one of the many praises of the daywhich were continually bursting forth captain wentworth added --what glorious weather for the admiral and my sister!  they meant to takea long drive this morning perhaps we may hail them fromsome of these hills  they talked of coming into this side of the countryi wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day  oh! it does happenvery often i assure you but my sister makes nothing of itshe would as lieve be tossed out as notah! you make the most of it i know cried louisa but if it werereally so i should do just the same in her place  if i loved a manas she loves the admiral i would always be with him nothing should everseparate us and i would rather be overturned by him than driven safelyby anybody elseit was spoken with enthusiasmhad you cried he catching the same tone i honour you!and there was silence between them for a little whileanne could not immediately fall into a quotation again  the sweet scenesof autumn were for a while put by unless some tender sonnetfraught with the apt analogy of the declining year with declininghappiness and the images of youth and hope and spring all gone togetherblessed her memory  she roused herself to say as they struck by orderinto another path is not this one of the ways to winthropbut nobody heard or at least nobody answered herwinthrop however or its environs--for young men are sometimesto be met with strolling about near home--was their destinationand after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosureswhere the ploughs at work and the fresh made path spoke the farmercounteracting the sweets of poetical despondence and meaningto have spring again they gained the summit of the most considerable hillwhich parted uppercross and winthrop and soon commanded a full viewof the latter at the foot of the hill on the other sidewinthrop without beauty and without dignity was stretched before theman indifferent house standing low and hemmed in by the barns andbuildings of a farm-yardmary exclaimed bless me! here is winthrop  i declare i had no idea!well now i think we had better turn back i am excessively tiredhenrietta conscious and ashamed and seeing no cousin charleswalking along any path or leaning against any gate was readyto do as mary wished but no! said charles musgrove and no no!cried louisa more eagerly and taking her sister aside seemed to bearguing the matter warmlycharles in the meanwhile was very decidedly declaring his resolutionof calling on his aunt now that he was so near and very evidentlythough more fearfully trying to induce his wife to go toobut this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strengthand when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarterof an hour at winthrop as she felt so tired she resolutely answeredoh! no indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harmthan any sitting down could do her good and in shorther look and manner declared that go she would notafter a little succession of these sort of debates and consultationsit was settled between charles and his two sisters that heand henrietta should just run down for a few minutes to see their auntand cousins while the rest of the party waited for them at the topof the hill  louisa seemed the principal arranger of the planand as she went a little way with them down the hill still talkingto henrietta mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around herand saying to captain wentworth--it is very unpleasant having such connexions!  but i assure youi have never been in the house above twice in my lifeshe received no other answer than an artificial assenting smilefollowed by a contemptuous glance as he turned away which anneperfectly knew the meaning ofthe brow of the hill where they remained was a cheerful spotlouisa returned and mary finding a comfortable seat for herselfon the step of a stile was very well satisfied so long as the othersall stood about her but when louisa drew captain wentworth awayto try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-rowand they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and soundmary was happy no longer she quarrelled with her own seatwas sure louisa had got a much better somewhere and nothing couldprevent her from going to look for a better also  she turned throughthe same gate but could not see them  anne found a nice seatfor her on a dry sunny bank under the hedge-row in whichshe had no doubt of their still being in some spot or othermary sat down for a moment but it would not do she was sure louisahad found a better seat somewhere else and she would go ontill she overtook heranne really tired herself was glad to sit down and she very soon heardcaptain wentworth and louisa in the hedge-row behind her as ifmaking their way back along the rough wild sort of channel down thecentre  they were speaking as they drew near  louisa's voice wasthe first distinguished  she seemed to be in the middle of someeager speech  what anne first heard was--and so i made her go  i could not bear that she should be frightenedfrom the visit by such nonsense  what! would i be turned back fromdoing a thing that i had determined to do and that i knew to be rightby the airs and interference of such a person or of any person i may sayno i have no idea of being so easily persuaded  when i havemade up my mind i have made it and henrietta seemed entirelyto have made up hers to call at winthrop to-day and yet she was as neargiving it up out of nonsensical complaisance!she would have turned back then but for youshe would indeed  i am almost ashamed to say ithappy for her to have such a mind as yours at hand!  after the hintsyou gave just now which did but confirm my own observationsthe last time i was in company with him  i need not affectto have no comprehension of what is going on  i see that more thana mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in questionand woe betide him and her too when it comes to things of consequencewhen they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude andstrength of mind if she have not resolution enough to resistidle interference in such a trifle as this  your sister isan amiable creature but yours is the character of decision and firmnessi see  if you value her conduct or happiness infuse as muchof your own spirit into her as you can  but this no doubtyou have been always doing  it is the worst evil of too yieldingand indecisive a character that no influence over it can be depended onyou are never sure of a good impression being durable everybodymay sway it  let those who would be happy be firm  here is a nutsaid he catching one down from an upper bough  to exemplifya beautiful glossy nut which blessed with original strengthhas outlived all the storms of autumn  not a puncture nota weak spot anywhere  this nut he continued with playful solemnitywhile so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under footis still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can besupposed capable of  then returning to his former earnest tone--my first wish for all whom i am interested in is that they should be firmif louisa musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her november of lifeshe will cherish all her present powers of mindhe had done and was unanswered  it would have surprised anne if louisacould have readily answered such a speech  words of such interestspoken with such serious warmth!  she could imagine what louisa was feelingfor herself she feared to move lest she should be seenwhile she remained a bush of low rambling holly protected herand they were moving on  before they were beyond her hearinghowever louisa spoke againmary is good-natured enough in many respects said shebut she does sometimes provoke me excessively by her nonsenseand pride--the elliot pride  she has a great deal too muchof the elliot pride  we do so wish that charles had married anne insteadi suppose you know he wanted to marry anneafter a moment's pause captain wentworth said--do you mean that she refused himoh! yes certainlywhen did that happeni do not exactly know for henrietta and i were at school at the timebut i believe about a year before he married mary  i wish she hadaccepted him  we should all have liked her a great deal betterand papa and mamma always think it was her great friendlady russell's doing that she did not  they think charlesmight not be learned and bookish enough to please lady russelland that therefore she persuaded anne to refuse himthe sounds were retreating and anne distinguished no moreher own emotions still kept her fixed  she had much to recover frombefore she could move  the listener's proverbial fate wasnot absolutely hers she had heard no evil of herself but she had hearda great deal of very painful import  she saw how her own characterwas considered by captain wentworth and there had been just that degreeof feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give herextreme agitationas soon as she could she went after mary and having foundand walked back with her to their former station by the stilefelt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwardscollected and once more in motion together  her spirits wantedthe solitude and silence which only numbers could givecharles and henrietta returned bringing as may be conjecturedcharles hayter with them  the minutiae of the business annecould not attempt to understand even captain wentworth did not seemadmitted to perfect confidence here but that there had been a withdrawingon the gentleman's side and a relenting on the lady's and that theywere now very glad to be together again did not admit a doubthenrietta looked a little ashamed but very well pleased--charles hayter exceedingly happy  and they were devoted to each otheralmost from the first instant of their all setting forward for uppercrosseverything now marked out louisa for captain wentworthnothing could be plainer and where many divisions were necessaryor even where they were not they walked side by side nearly as muchas the other two  in a long strip of meadow land where there wasample space for all they were thus divided forming three distinct partiesand to that party of the three which boasted least animationand least complaisance anne necessarily belonged  she joined charlesand mary and was tired enough to be very glad of charles's other armbut charles though in very good humour with her was out of temperwith his wife  mary had shewn herself disobliging to himand was now to reap the consequence which consequence washis dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the headsof some nettles in the hedge with his switch and when mary beganto complain of it and lament her being ill-used according to customin being on the hedge side while anne was never incommoded on the otherhe dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he hada momentary glance of and they could hardly get him along at allthis long meadow bordered a lane which their footpath at the end of itwas to cross and when the party had all reached the gate of exitthe carriage advancing in the same direction which had beensome time heard was just coming up and proved to be admiral croft's gighe and his wife had taken their intended drive and were returning homeupon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged inthey kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tiredit would save her a full mile and they were going through uppercrossthe invitation was general and generally declined  the miss musgroveswere not at all tired and mary was either offended by not being askedbefore any of the others or what louisa called the elliot pridecould not endure to make a third in a one horse chaisethe walking party had crossed the lane and were surmounting anopposite stile and the admiral was putting his horse in motion againwhen captain wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say somethingto his sister  the something might be guessed by its effectsmiss elliot i am sure you are tired cried mrs croftdo let us have the pleasure of taking you home  here is excellent roomfor three i assure you  if we were all like you i believe we mightsit four  you must indeed you mustanne was still in the lane and though instinctively beginning to declineshe was not allowed to proceed  the admiral's kind urgencycame in support of his wife's they would not be refusedthey compressed themselves into the smallest possible spaceto leave her a corner and captain wentworth without saying a wordturned to her and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriageyes he had done it  she was in the carriage and felt that he hadplaced her there that his will and his hands had done itthat she owed it to his perception of her fatigue and his resolutionto give her rest  she was very much affected by the view ofhis disposition towards her which all these things made apparentthis little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone beforeshe understood him  he could not forgive her but he could notbe unfeeling  though condemning her for the past and considering itwith high and unjust resentment though perfectly careless of herand though becoming attached to another still he could not see her sufferwithout the desire of giving her relief  it was a remainderof former sentiment it was an impulse of pure though unacknowledgedfriendship it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heartwhich she could not contemplate without emotions so compoundedof pleasure and pain that she knew not which prevailedher answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companionswere at first unconsciously given  they had travelled half their wayalong the rough lane before she was quite awake to what they saidshe then found them talking of frederickhe certainly means to have one or other of those two girls sophysaid the admiral but there is no saying which  he has beenrunning after them too long enough one would think to make up his minday this comes of the peace  if it were war now he would havesettled it long ago  we sailors miss elliot cannot afford to makelong courtships in time of war  how many days was it my dearbetween the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down togetherin our lodgings at north yarmouthwe had better not talk about it my dear replied mrs croft pleasantlyfor if miss elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understandingshe would never be persuaded that we could be happy togetheri had known you by character however long beforewell and i had heard of you as a very pretty girl and what were weto wait for besides  i do not like having such things so long in handi wish frederick would spread a little more canvass and bring us homeone of these young ladies to kellynch  then there would alwaysbe company for them  and very nice young ladies they both arei hardly know one from the othervery good humoured unaffected girls indeed said mrs croftin a tone of calmer praise such as made anne suspect thather keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthyof her brother and a very respectable family  one could not beconnected with better people  my dear admiral that post!we shall certainly take that postbut by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happilypassed the danger and by once afterwards judiciously putting outher hand they neither fell into a rut nor ran foul of a dung-cartand anne with some amusement at their style of drivingwhich she imagined no bad representation of the general guidanceof their affairs found herself safely deposited by them at the cottagechapter 11the time now approached for lady russell's return  the day was even fixedand anne being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettledwas looking forward to an early removal to kellynch and beginningto think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by itit would place her in the same village with captain wentworthwithin half a mile of him they would have to frequent the same churchand there must be intercourse between the two familiesthis was against her but on the other hand he spent so much of his timeat uppercross that in removing thence she might be considered ratheras leaving him behind than as going towards him and upon the wholeshe believed she must on this interesting question be the gaineralmost as certainly as in her change of domestic societyin leaving poor mary for lady russellshe wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeingcaptain wentworth at the hall  those rooms had witnessedformer meetings which would be brought too painfully before herbut she was yet more anxious for the possibility of lady russell andcaptain wentworth never meeting anywhere  they did not like each otherand no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good and were lady russellto see them together she might think that he had too much self-possessionand she too littlethese points formed her chief solicitude in anticipatingher removal from uppercross where she felt she had been stationedquite long enough  her usefulness to little charles would alwaysgive some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit therebut he was gaining strength apace and she had nothing else to stay forthe conclusion of her visit however was diversified in a waywhich she had not at all imagined  captain wentworth after being unseenand unheard of at uppercross for two whole days appeared again among themto justify himself by a relation of what had kept him awaya letter from his friend captain harville having found him out at lasthad brought intelligence of captain harville's being settledwith his family at lyme for the winter of their being thereforequite unknowingly within twenty miles of each other  captain harvillehad never been in good health since a severe wound which he receivedtwo years before and captain wentworth's anxiety to see himhad determined him to go immediately to lyme  he had been therefor four-and-twenty hours  his acquittal was completehis friendship warmly honoured a lively interest excited for his friendand his description of the fine country about lyme so feelingly attended toby the party that an earnest desire to see lyme themselvesand a project for going thither was the consequencethe young people were all wild to see lyme  captain wentworth talkedof going there again himself it was only seventeen miles from uppercrossthough november the weather was by no means bad and in shortlouisa who was the most eager of the eager having formedthe resolution to go and besides the pleasure of doing as she likedbeing now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own waybore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it offtill summer and to lyme they were to go--charles mary anne henriettalouisa and captain wentworththe first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at nightbut to this mr musgrove for the sake of his horses would not consentand when it came to be rationally considered a day inthe middle of november would not leave much time for seeing a new placeafter deducting seven hours as the nature of the country requiredfor going and returning  they were consequently to stay the night thereand not to be expected back till the next day's dinner  this was feltto be a considerable amendment and though they all met at the great houseat rather an early breakfast hour and set off very punctuallyit was so much past noon before the two carriages mr musgrove's coachcontaining the four ladies and charles's curricle in whichhe drove captain wentworth were descending the long hill into lymeand entering upon the still steeper street of the town itselfthat it was very evident they would not have more than timefor looking about them before the light and warmth of the day were goneafter securing accommodations and ordering a dinner at one of the innsthe next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directlydown to the sea  they were come too late in the year for any amusementor variety which lyme as a public place might offer  the

wonders and new improvements with the very beautifulline of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town are whatthe stranger's eye will seek and a very strange stranger it must bewho does not see

the far-famedisle of wight  these places must be visited and visited againto make the worth of lyme understoodthe party from uppercross passing down by the now desertedand melancholy looking rooms and still descending soon found themselveson the sea-shore and lingering only as all must linger and gazeon a first return to the sea who ever deserved to look on it at allproceeded towards the cobb equally their object in itselfand on captain wentworth's account  for in a small housenear the foot of an old pier of unknown date were the harvilles settledcaptain wentworth turned in to call on his friend the others walked onand he was to join them on the cobbthey were by no means tired of wondering and admiring and not even louisaseemed to feel that they had parted with captain wentworth longwhen they saw him coming after them with three companionsall well known already by description to be captain and mrs harvilleand a captain benwick who was staying with themcaptain benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the laconiaand the account which captain wentworth had given of himon his return from lyme before his warm praise of him asan excellent young man and an officer whom he had always valued highlywhich must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listenerhad been followed by a little history of his private lifewhich rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladieshe had been engaged to captain harville's sister and was nowmourning her loss  they had been a year or two waiting for fortuneand promotion  fortune came his prize-money as lieutenant being greatpromotion too came at last but fanny harville did not live to know itshe had died the preceding summer while he was at sea  captain wentworthbelieved it impossible for man to be more attached to womanthan poor benwick had been to fanny harville or to be more deeplyafflicted under the dreadful change  he considered his dispositionas of the sort which must suffer heavily uniting very strong feelingswith quiet serious and retiring manners and a decided taste for readingand sedentary pursuits  to finish the interest of the storythe friendship between him and the harvilles seemed if possibleaugmented by the event which closed all their views of allianceand captain benwick was now living with them entirely  captain harvillehad taken his present house for half a year his taste and his healthand his fortune all directing him to a residence inexpensiveand by the sea and the grandeur of the country and the retirementof lyme in the winter appeared exactly adapted to captain benwick'sstate of mind  the sympathy and good-will excited towards captain benwickwas very greatand yet said anne to herself as they now moved forwardto meet the party he has not perhaps a more sorrowing heartthan i have  i cannot believe his prospects so blighted for everhe is younger than i am younger in feeling if not in factyounger as a man  he will rally again and be happy with anotherthey all met and were introduced  captain harville was a talldark man with a sensible benevolent countenance a little lameand from strong features and want of health looking much olderthan captain wentworth  captain benwick looked and wasthe youngest of the three and compared with either of thema little man  he had a pleasing face and a melancholy airjust as he ought to have and drew back from conversationcaptain harville though not equalling captain wentworth in mannerswas a perfect gentleman unaffected warm and obligingmrs harville a degree less polished than her husband seemed howeverto have the same good feelings and nothing could be more pleasantthan their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their ownbecause the friends of captain wentworth or more kindly hospitablethan their entreaties for their all promising to dine with themthe dinner already ordered at the inn was at last though unwillinglyaccepted as a excuse but they seemed almost hurt that captain wentworthshould have brought any such party to lyme without considering itas a thing of course that they should dine with themthere was so much attachment to captain wentworth in all thisand such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommonso unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations and dinnersof formality and display that anne felt her spirits not likely to bebenefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officersthese would have been all my friends was her thoughtand she had to struggle against a great tendency to lownesson quitting the cobb they all went in-doors with their new friendsand found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heartcould think capable of accommodating so many  anne hada moment's astonishment on the subject herself but it was soon lostin the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of allthe ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of captain harvilleto turn the actual space to the

necessariesprovided by the owner in the common indifferent plightwere contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of woodexcellently worked up and with something curious and valuablefrom all

already that nothing was found amiss though its beingso entirely out of season and the no thoroughfare of lymeand the no expectation of company had brought many apologiesfrom the heads of the innanne found herself by this time growing so much more hardenedto being in captain wentworth's company than she had at first imaginedcould ever be that the sitting down to the same table with him nowand the interchange of the common civilities attending on itthey never got beyond was become a mere nothingthe nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrowbut captain harville had promised them a visit in the eveningand he came bringing his friend also which was more thanhad been expected it having been agreed that captain benwickhad all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence ofso many strangers  he ventured among them again howeverthough his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirthof the party in generalwhile captains wentworth and harville led the talk on one side of the roomand by recurring to former days supplied anecdotes in abundanceto occupy and entertain the others it fell to anne's lot to be placedrather apart with captain benwick and a very good impulseof her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with himhe was shy and disposed to abstraction but the engaging mildness ofher countenance and gentleness of her manners soon had their effectand anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertionhe was evidently a young man of considerable taste in readingthough principally in poetry and besides the persuasion of havinggiven him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjectswhich his usual companions had probably no concern in she had the hopeof being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty andbenefit of struggling against affliction which had naturally grown outof their conversation  for though shy he did not seem reservedit had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst theirusual restraints and having talked of poetry the richness ofthe present age and gone through a brief comparison of opinionas to the first-rate poets trying to ascertain whether marmionor the lady of the lake were to be preferred and how ranked the giaourand the bride of abydos and moreover how the giaour was to be pronouncedhe showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songsof the one poet and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agonyof the other he repeated with such tremulous feeling the various lineswhich imaged a broken heart or a mind destroyed by wretchednessand looked so entirely as if he meant to be understoodthat she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetryand to say that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to beseldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completelyand that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it trulywere the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparinglyhis looks shewing him not pained but pleased with this allusionto his situation she was emboldened to go on and feeling in herselfthe right of seniority of mind she ventured to recommenda larger allowance of prose in his daily study and on being requestedto particularize mentioned such works of our best moralistssuch collections of the finest letters such memoirs of charactersof worth and suffering as occurred to her at the momentas calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest preceptsand the strongest examples of moral and religious endurancescaptain benwick listened attentively and seemed grateful forthe interest implied and though with a shake of the headand sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any bookson grief like his noted down the names of those she recommendedand promised to procure and read themwhen the evening was over anne could not but be amused at the ideaof her coming to lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young manwhom she had never seen before nor could she help fearingon more serious reflection that like many other great moralistsand preachers she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conductwould ill bear examinationchapter 12anne and henrietta finding themselves the earliest of the partythe next morning agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfastthey went to the sands to watch the flowing of the tidewhich a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeurwhich so flat a shore admitted  they praised the morninggloried in the sea sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feelingbreeze--and were silent till henrietta suddenly began again with--oh! yes--i am quite convinced that with very few exceptionsthe sea-air always does good  there can be no doubt of its having beenof the greatest service to dr shirley after his illnesslast spring twelve-month  he declares himself that coming to lymefor a month did him more good than all the medicine he tookand that being by the sea always makes him feel young againnow i cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not liveentirely by the sea  i do think he had better leave uppercross entirelyand fix at lyme  do not you anne  do not you agree with methat it is the best thing he could do both for himself and mrs shirleyshe has cousins here you know and many acquaintance which wouldmake it cheerful for her and i am sure she would be gladto get to a place where she could have medical attendance at handin case of his having another seizure  indeed i think it quite melancholyto have such excellent people as dr and mrs shirley who have beendoing good all their lives wearing out their last days in a placelike uppercross where excepting our family they seem shut outfrom all the world  i wish his friends would propose it to himi really think they ought  and as to procuring a dispensationthere could be no difficulty at his time of life and with his charactermy only doubt is whether anything could persuade him to leave his parishhe is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions over-scrupulousi must say  do not you think anne it is being over-scrupulousdo not you think it is quite a mistaken point of consciencewhen a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of dutieswhich may be just as well performed by another person  and at lyme tooonly seventeen miles off he would be near enough to hearif people thought there was anything to complain ofanne smiled more than once to herself during this speechand entered into the subject as ready to do good by entering intothe feelings of a young lady as of a young man though here it was goodof a lower standard for what could be offered but general acquiescenceshe said all that was reasonable and proper on the businessfelt the claims of dr shirley to repose as she ought saw how verydesirable it was that he should have some active respectable young manas a resident curate and was even courteous enough to hint atthe advantage of such resident curate's being marriedi wish said henrietta very well pleased with her companioni wish lady russell lived at uppercross and were intimatewith dr shirley  i have always heard of lady russell as a woman ofthe greatest influence with everybody!  i always look upon her as ableto persuade a person to anything!  i am afraid of her as i havetold you before quite afraid of her because she is so very cleverbut i respect her amazingly and wish we had such a neighbourat uppercrossanne was amused by henrietta's manner of being gratefuland amused also that the course of events and the new interestsof henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favourwith any of the musgrove family she had only time howeverfor a general answer and a wish that such another womanwere at uppercross before all subjects suddenly ceasedon seeing louisa and captain wentworth coming towards themthey came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be readybut louisa recollecting immediately afterwards that she had somethingto procure at a shop invited them all to go back with her into the townthey were all at her disposalwhen they came to the steps leading upwards from the beach a gentlemanat the same moment preparing to come down politely drew backand stopped to give them way  they ascended and passed himand as they passed anne's face caught his eye and he looked at herwith a degree of earnest admiration which she could not be insensible ofshe was looking remarkably well her very regular very pretty featureshaving the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine windwhich had been blowing on her complexion and by the animation of eyewhich it had also produced  it was evident that the gentlemancompletely a gentleman in manner admired her exceedinglycaptain wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way whichshewed his noticing of it  he gave her a momentary glancea glance of brightness which seemed to say that man is struck with youand even i at this moment see something like anne elliot againafter attending louisa through her business and loitering abouta little longer they returned to the inn and anne in passing afterwardsquickly from her own chamber to their dining-room had nearly run againstthe very same gentleman as he came out of an adjoining apartmentshe had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselvesand determined that a well-looking groom who was strolling aboutnear the two inns as they came back should be his servantboth master and man being in mourning assisted the ideait was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselvesand this second meeting short as it was also proved againby the gentleman's looks that he thought hers very lovelyand by the readiness and propriety of his apologies that he wasa man of exceedingly good manners  he seemed about thirtyand though not handsome had an agreeable person  anne felt thatshe should like to know who he wasthey had nearly done breakfast when the sound of a carriagealmost the first they had heard since entering lyme drew half the partyto the window  it was a gentleman's carriage a curriclebut only coming round from the stable-yard to the front doorsomebody must be going away  it was driven by a servant in mourningthe word curricle made charles musgrove jump up that he mightcompare it with his own the servant in mourning roused anne's curiosityand the whole six were collected to look by the time the ownerof the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bowsand civilities of the household and taking his seat to drive offah! cried captain wentworth instantly and with half a glance at anneit is the very man we passedthe miss musgroves agreed to it and having all kindly watched himas far up the hill as they could they returned to the breakfast tablethe waiter came into the room soon afterwardspray said captain wentworth immediately can you tell us the nameof the gentleman who is just gone awayyes sir a mr elliot a gentleman of large fortune came in last nightfrom sidmouth  dare say you heard the carriage sir while you wereat dinner and going on now for crewkherne in his way to bathand londonelliot!  many had looked on each other and many had repeated the namebefore all this had been got through even by the smart rapidityof a waiterbless me! cried mary it must be our cousin it must be our mr elliotit must indeed!  charles anne must not it  in mourning you seejust as our mr elliot must be  how very extraordinary!in the very same inn with us!  anne must not it be our mr elliotmy father's next heir  pray sir turning to the waiterdid not you hear did not his servant say whether he belongedto the kellynch familyno ma'am he did not mention no particular family but he saidhis master was a very rich gentleman and would be a baronight some daythere! you see! cried mary in an ecstasy just as i said!heir to sir walter elliot!  i was sure that would come outif it was so  depend upon it that is a circumstance which his servantstake care to publish wherever he goes  but anne only conceivehow extraordinary!  i wish i had looked at him more  i wish we hadbeen aware in time who it was that he might have been introduced to uswhat a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!do you think he had the elliot countenance  i hardly looked at himi was looking at the horses but i think he had somethingof the elliot countenance i wonder the arms did not strike me!oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel and hid the armsso it did otherwise i am sure i should have observed themand the livery too if the servant had not been in mourningone should have known him by the liveryputting all these very extraordinary circumstances togethersaid captain wentworth we must consider it to be the arrangementof providence that you should not be introduced to your cousinwhen she could command mary's attention anne quietly triedto convince her that their father and mr elliot had not for many yearsbeen on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introductionat all desirableat the same time however it was a secret gratification to herselfto have seen her cousin and to know that the future owner of kellynchwas undoubtedly a gentleman and had an air of good senseshe would not upon any account mention her having met with himthe second time luckily mary did not much attend to their havingpassed close by him in their earlier walk but she would have feltquite ill-used by anne's having actually run against him in the passageand received his very polite excuses while she had never beennear him at all no that cousinly little interview must remaina perfect secretof course said mary you will mention our seeing mr elliotthe next time you write to bath  i think my father certainlyought to hear of it do mention all about himanne avoided a direct reply but it was just the circumstancewhich she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicatedbut as what ought to be suppressed  the offence which had been givenher father many years back she knew elizabeth's particular share in itshe suspected and that mr elliot's idea always produced irritation in bothwas beyond a doubt  mary never wrote to bath herself all the toilof keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with elizabethfell on annebreakfast had not been long over when they were joined by captainand mrs harville and captain benwick with whom they had appointedto take their last walk about lyme  they ought to be setting offfor uppercross by one and in the mean while were to be all togetherand out of doors as long as they couldanne found captain benwick getting near her as soon as they were allfairly in the street  their conversation the preceding eveningdid not disincline him to seek her again and they walked togethersome time talking as before of mr scott and lord byronand still as unable as before and as unable as any other two readersto think exactly alike of the merits of either till somethingoccasioned an almost general change amongst their party and instead ofcaptain benwick she had captain harville by her sidemiss elliot said he speaking rather low you have done a good deedin making that poor fellow talk so much  i wish he could havesuch company oftener  it is bad for him i know to be shut up as he isbut what can we do  we cannot partno said anne that i can easily believe to be impossiblebut in time perhaps--we know what time does in every case of afflictionand you must remember captain harville that your friendmay yet be called a young mourner--only last summer i understanday true enough with a deep sigh only juneand not known to him perhaps so soonnot till the first week of august when he came home from the capejust made into the grappler  i was at plymouth dreading to hear of himhe sent in letters but the grappler was under orders for portsmouththere the news must follow him but who was to tell it not ii would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm  nobody could do itbut that good fellow pointing to captain wentworth  the laconiahad come into plymouth the week before no danger of herbeing sent to sea again  he stood his chance for the restwrote up for leave of absence but without waiting the returntravelled night and day till he got to portsmouth rowed offto the grappler that instant and never left the poor fellow for a weekthat's what he did and nobody else could have saved poor jamesyou may think miss elliot whether he is dear to us!anne did think on the question with perfect decision and said as muchin reply as her own feeling could accomplish or as his seemedable to bear for he was too much affected to renew the subjectand when he spoke again it was of something totally differentmrs harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would havequite walking enough by the time he reached home determined the directionof all the party in what was to be their last walk they wouldaccompany them to their door and then return and set off themselvesby all their calculations there was just time for this but as they drewnear the cobb there was such a general wish to walk along it once moreall were so inclined and louisa soon grew so determinedthat the difference of a quarter of an hour it was foundwould be no difference at all so with all the kind leave-takingand all the kind interchange of invitations and promises whichmay be imagined they parted from captain and mrs harvilleat their own door and still accompanied by captain benwickwho seemed to cling to them to the last proceeded to makethe proper adieus to the cobbanne found captain benwick again drawing near her  lord byron'sdark blue seas could not fail of being brought forward bytheir present view and she gladly gave him all her attention as long asattention was possible  it was soon drawn perforce another waythere was too much wind to make the high part of the new cobb pleasantfor the ladies and they agreed to get down the steps to the lowerand all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flightexcepting louisa she must be jumped down them by captain wentworthin all their walks he had had to jump her from the stilesthe sensation was delightful to her  the hardness of the pavementfor her feet made him less willing upon the present occasionhe did it however  she was safely down and instantlyto show her enjoyment ran up the steps to be jumped down againhe advised her against it thought the jar too great but nohe reasoned and talked in vain she smiled and said i am determinedi will he put out his hands she was too precipitate by half a secondshe fell on the pavement on the lower cobb and was taken up lifeless!there was no wound no blood no visible bruise but her eyes were closedshe breathed not her face was like death  the horror of the momentto all who stood around!captain wentworth who had caught her up knelt with her in his armslooking on her with a face as pallid as her own in an agony of silenceshe is dead! she is dead! screamed mary catching hold of herhusband and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveableand in another moment henrietta sinking under the conviction losther senses too and would have fallen on the steps but for captainbenwick and anne who caught and supported her between themis there no one to help me were the first words whichburst from captain wentworth in a tone of despair and as ifall his own strength were gonego to him go to him cried anne for heaven's sake go to himi can support her myself  leave me and go to him  rub her handsrub her temples here are salts take them take themcaptain benwick obeyed and charles at the same momentdisengaging himself from his wife they were both with himand louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between themand everything was done that anne had prompted but in vainwhile captain wentworth staggering against the wall for his supportexclaimed in the bitterest agony--oh god! her father and mother!a surgeon! said annehe caught the word it seemed to rouse him at once and saying only--true true a surgeon this instant was darting awaywhen anne eagerly suggested--captain benwick would not it be better for captain benwickhe knows where a surgeon is to be foundevery one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the ideaand in a moment it was all done in rapid moments captain benwick hadresigned the poor corpse-like  figure entirely to the brother's careand was off for the town with the utmost rapidityas to the wretched party left behind it could scarcely be saidwhich of the three who were completely rational was suffering mostcaptain wentworth anne or charles who really a very affectionatebrother hung over louisa with sobs of grief and could only turn his eyesfrom one sister to see the other in a state as insensibleor to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife calling on himfor help which he could not giveanne attending with all the strength and zeal and thoughtwhich instinct supplied to henrietta still tried at intervalsto suggest comfort to the others tried to quiet mary to animate charlesto assuage the feelings of captain wentworth  both seemed to look to herfor directionsanne anne cried charles what is to be done nextwhat in heaven's name is to be done nextcaptain wentworth's eyes were also turned towards herhad not she better be carried to the inn  yes i am surecarry her gently to the innyes yes to the inn repeated captain wentworth comparativelycollected and eager to be doing something  i will carry her myselfmusgrove take care of the othersby this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmenand boatmen about the cobb and many were collected near themto be useful if wanted at any rate to enjoy the sight ofa dead young lady nay two dead young ladies for it proved twice as fineas the first report  to some of the best-looking of these good peoplehenrietta was consigned for though partially revivedshe was quite helpless and in this manner anne walking by her sideand charles attending to his wife they set forward treading backwith feelings unutterable the ground which so lately so very latelyand so light of heart they had passed alongthey were not off the cobb before the harvilles met themcaptain benwick had been seen flying by their house with a countenancewhich showed something to be wrong and they had set off immediatelyinformed and directed as they passed towards the spotshocked as captain harville was he brought senses and nervesthat could be instantly useful and a look between him and his wifedecided what was to be done  she must be taken to their houseall must go to their house and await the surgeon's arrival therethey would not listen to scruples  he was obeyed they were allbeneath his roof and while louisa under mrs harville's directionwas conveyed up stairs and given possession of her own bedassistance cordials restoratives were supplied by her husbandto all who needed themlouisa had once opened her eyes but soon closed them againwithout apparent consciousness  this had been a proof of lifehowever of service to her sister and henrietta though perfectlyincapable of being in the same room with louisa was keptby the agitation of hope and fear from a return of her own insensibilitymary too was growing calmerthe surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possiblethey were sick with horror while he examined but he was not hopelessthe head had received a severe contusion but he had seen greater injuriesrecovered from  he was by no means hopeless he spoke cheerfullythat he did not regard it as a desperate case that he did not saya few hours must end it was at first felt beyond the hope of mostand the ecstasy of such a reprieve the rejoicing deep and silentafter a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to heaven had been offeredmay be conceivedthe tone the look with which thank god! was utteredby captain wentworth anne was sure could never be forgotten by hernor the sight of him afterwards as he sat near a table leaning over itwith folded arms and face concealed as if overpowered bythe various feelings of his soul and trying by prayer and reflectionto calm themlouisa's limbs had escaped  there was no injury but to the headit now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be doneas to their general situation  they were now able to speak to each otherand consult  that louisa must remain where she was however distressingto her friends to be involving the harvilles in such troubledid not admit a doubt  her removal was impossible  the harvillessilenced all scruples and as much as they could all gratitudethey had looked forward and arranged everything before the othersbegan to reflect  captain benwick must give up his room to themand get another bed elsewhere and the whole was settledthey were only concerned that the house could accommodate no moreand yet perhaps by putting the children away in the maid's roomor swinging a cot somewhere they could hardly bear to think of notfinding room for two or three besides supposing they might wish to staythough with regard to any attendance on miss musgrove there need not bethe least uneasiness in leaving her to mrs harville's care entirelymrs harville was a very experienced nurse and her nursery-maidwho had lived with her long and gone about with her everywherewas just such another  between these two she could wantno possible attendance by day or night  and all this was saidwith a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistiblecharles henrietta and captain wentworth were the three in consultationand for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terroruppercross the necessity of some one's going to uppercrossthe news to be conveyed how it could be broken to mr and mrs musgrovethe lateness of the morning an hour already gone since theyought to have been off the impossibility of being in tolerable timeat first they were capable of nothing more to the purposethan such exclamations but after a while captain wentworthexerting himself said--we must be decided and without the loss of another minuteevery minute is valuable  some one must resolve on being offfor uppercross instantly  musgrove either you or i must gocharles agreed but declared his resolution of not going awayhe would be as little incumbrance as possible to captain and mrs harvillebut as to leaving his sister in such a state he neither ought nor wouldso far it was decided and henrietta at first declared the sameshe however was soon persuaded to think differently  the usefulnessof her staying!  she who had not been able to remain in louisa's roomor to look at her without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!she was forced to acknowledge that she could do no goodyet was still unwilling to be away till touched by the thoughtof her father and mother she gave it up she consentedshe was anxious to be at homethe plan had reached this point when anne coming quietlydown from louisa's room could not but hear what followedfor the parlour door was openthen it is settled musgrove cried captain wentworththat you stay and that i take care of your sister homebut as to the rest as to the others if one stays to assist mrs harvillei think it need be only one  mrs charles musgrove will of coursewish to get back to her children but if anne will stay no one so properso capable as anneshe paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herselfso spoken of  the other two warmly agreed with what he saidand she then appearedyou will stay i am sure you will stay and nurse her cried heturning to her and speaking with a glow and yet a gentlenesswhich seemed almost restoring the past  she coloured deeplyand he recollected himself and moved away  she expressed herselfmost willing ready happy to remain  it was what she had beenthinking of and wishing to be allowed to do  a bed on the floorin louisa's room would be sufficient for her if mrs harvillewould but think soone thing more and all seemed arranged  though it was rather desirablethat mr and mrs musgrove should be previously alarmed by someshare of delay yet the time required by the uppercross horsesto take them back would be a dreadful extension of suspenseand captain wentworth proposed and charles musgrove agreedthat it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the innand leave mr musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent homethe next morning early when there would be the farther advantageof sending an account of louisa's nightcaptain wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his partand to be soon followed by the two ladies  when the plan wasmade known to mary however there was an end of all peace in itshe was so wretched and so vehement complained so much of injusticein being expected to go away instead of anne anne who wasnothing to louisa while she was her sister and had the best rightto stay in henrietta's stead!  why was not she to be as useful as anneand to go home without charles too without her husband!no it was too unkind  and in short she said more than her husbandcould long withstand and as none of the others could opposewhen he gave way there was no help for it the change of mary for annewas inevitableanne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealousand ill-judging claims of mary but so it must be and they set offfor the town charles taking care of his sister and captain benwickattending to her  she gave a moment's recollection as they hurried alongto the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessedearlier in the morning  there she had listened to henrietta's schemesfor dr shirley's leaving uppercross farther on she hadfirst seen mr elliot a moment seemed all that could now be givento any one but louisa or those who were wrapt up in her welfarecaptain benwick was most considerately attentive to her andunited as they all seemed by the distress of the day she feltan increasing degree of good-will towards him and a pleasure evenin thinking that it might perhaps be the occasion of continuingtheir acquaintancecaptain wentworth was on the watch for them and a chaise and four in waitingstationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the streetbut his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sisterfor the other the change in his countenance the astonishmentthe expressions begun and suppressed with which charles was listened tomade but a mortifying reception of anne or must at least convince herthat she was valued only as she could be useful to louisashe endeavoured to be composed and to be just  without emulatingthe feelings of an emma towards her henry she would haveattended on louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regardfor his sake and she hoped he would not long be so unjustas to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friendin the mean while she was in the carriage  he had handed them both inand placed himself between them and in this manner under thesecircumstances full of astonishment and emotion to anne she quitted lymehow the long stage would pass how it was to affect their mannerswhat was to be their sort of intercourse she could not foreseeit was all quite natural however  he was devoted to henriettaalways turning towards her and when he spoke at all always with the viewof supporting her hopes and raising her spirits  in generalhis voice and manner were studiously calm  to spare henriettafrom agitation seemed the governing principle  once onlywhen she had been grieving over the last ill-judged ill-fatedwalk to the cobb bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought ofhe burst forth as if wholly overcome--don't talk of it don't talk of it he cried  oh god! that i hadnot given way to her at the fatal moment!  had i done as i ought!but so eager and so resolute! dear sweet louisa!anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now to question the justnessof his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantageof firmness of character and whether it might not strike him thatlike all other qualities of the mind it should have its proportionsand limits  she thought it could scarcely escape him to feelthat a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happinessas a very resolute characterthey got on fast  anne was astonished to recognise the same hillsand the same objects so soon  their actual speed heightened bysome dread of the conclusion made the road appear but half as longas on the day before  it was growing quite dusk howeverbefore they were in the neighbourhood of uppercross and there had beentotal silence among them for some time henrietta leaning backin the corner with a shawl over her face giving the hope of herhaving cried herself to sleep when as they were going up their last hillanne found herself all at once addressed by captain wentworthin a low cautious voice he said --i have been considering what we had best do  she must notappear at first  she could not stand it  i have been thinking whetheryou had not better remain in the carriage with her while i go inand break it to mr and mrs musgrove  do you think this is a good planshe did  he was satisfied and said no more  but the remembranceof the appeal remained a pleasure to her as a proof of friendshipand of deference for her judgement a great pleasure and when it becamea sort of parting proof its value did not lessenwhen the distressing communication at uppercross was overand he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hopedand the daughter all the better for being with them he announcedhis intention of returning in the same carriage to lymeand when the horses were baited he was offend of volume onechapter 13the remainder of anne's time at uppercross comprehending only two dayswas spent entirely at the mansion house and she had the satisfactionof knowing herself extremely useful there both as an immediate companionand as assisting in all those arrangements for the future whichin mr and mrs musgrove's distressed state of spirits would havebeen difficultiesthey had an early account from lyme the next morning  louisa wasmuch the same  no symptoms worse than before had appearedcharles came a few hours afterwards to bring a later andmore particular account  he was tolerably cheerful  a speedy curemust not be hoped but everything was going on as wellas the nature of the case admitted  in speaking of the harvilleshe seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindnessespecially of mrs harville's exertions as a nurse  she really leftnothing for mary to do  he and mary had been persuaded to go earlyto their inn last night  mary had been hysterical again this morningwhen he came away she was going to walk out with captain benwickwhich he hoped would do her good  he almost wished she had beenprevailed on to come home the day before but the truth wasthat mrs harville left nothing for anybody to docharles was to return to lyme the same afternoon and his fatherhad at first half a mind to go with him but the ladies could not consentit would be going only to multiply trouble to the othersand increase his own distress and a much better scheme followedand was acted upon  a chaise was sent for from crewkherneand charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maidof the family one who having brought up all the childrenand seen the very last the lingering and long-petted master harrysent to school after his brothers was now living in her deserted nurseryto mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she couldget near her and who consequently was only too happy in beingallowed to go and help nurse dear miss louisa  vague wishes ofgetting sarah thither had occurred before to mrs musgrove and henriettabut without anne it would hardly have been resolved onand found practicable so soonthey were indebted the next day to charles hayter for allthe minute knowledge of louisa which it was so essential to obtainevery twenty-four hours  he made it his business to go to lymeand his account was still encouraging  the intervals of senseand consciousness were believed to be stronger  every report agreedin captain wentworth's appearing fixed in lymeanne was to leave them on the morrow an event which they all dreadedwhat should they do without her  they were wretched comfortersfor one another  and so much was said in this way that anne thoughtshe could not do better than impart among them the general inclinationto which she was privy and persuaded them all to go to lyme at onceshe had little difficulty it was soon determined that they would gogo to-morrow fix themselves at the inn or get into lodgingsas it suited and there remain till dear louisa could be movedthey must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was withthey might at least relieve mrs harville from the care of her own childrenand in short they were so happy in the decision that anne was delightedwith what she had done and felt that she could not spend herlast morning at uppercross better than in assisting their preparationsand sending them off at an early hour though her being leftto the solitary range of the house was the consequenceshe was the last excepting the little boys at the cottageshe was the very last the only remaining one of all that had filledand animated both houses of all that had given uppercrossits cheerful character  a few days had made a change indeed!if louisa recovered it would all be well again  more thanformer happiness would be restored  there could not be a doubtto her mind there was none of what would follow her recoverya few months hence and the room now so deserted occupied but byher silent pensive self might be filled again with all that was happyand gay all that was glowing and bright in prosperous loveall that was most unlike anne elliot!an hour's complete leisure for such reflections as theseon a dark november day a small thick rain almost blotting outthe very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows was enoughto make the sound of lady russell's carriage exceedingly welcomeand yet though desirous to be gone she could not quit the mansion houseor look an adieu to the cottage with its black dripping andcomfortless veranda or even notice through the misty glassesthe last humble tenements of the village without a saddened heartscenes had passed in uppercross which made it preciousit stood the record of many sensations of pain once severebut now softened and of some instances of relenting feelingsome breathings of friendship and reconciliation which couldnever be looked for again and which could never cease to be dearshe left it all behind her all but the recollection thatsuch things had beenanne had never entered kellynch since her quitting lady russell's housein september  it had not been necessary and the few occasions ofits being possible for her to go to the hall she had contrived to evadeand escape from  her first return was to resume her place in the modernand elegant apartments of the lodge and to gladden the eyesof its mistressthere was some anxiety mixed with lady russell's joy in meeting hershe knew who had been frequenting uppercross  but happilyeither anne was improved in plumpness and looks or lady russellfancied her so and anne in receiving her compliments on the occasionhad the amusement of connecting them with the silent admirationof her cousin and of hoping that she was to be blessed witha second spring of youth and beautywhen they came to converse she was soon sensible of some mental changethe subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving kellynchand which she had felt slighted and been compelled to smotheramong the musgroves were now become but of secondary interestshe had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and baththeir concerns had been sunk under those of uppercrossand when lady russell reverted to their former hopes and fearsand spoke her satisfaction in the house in camden placewhich had been taken and her regret that mrs clay should stillbe with them anne would have been ashamed to have it knownhow much more she was thinking of lyme and louisa musgroveand all her acquaintance there how much more interesting to herwas the home and the friendship of the harvilles and captain benwickthan her own father's house in camden place or her own sister's intimacywith mrs clay  she was actually forced to exert herselfto meet lady russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitudeon topics which had by nature the first claim on herthere was a little awkwardness at first in their discourseon another subject  they must speak of the accident at lymelady russell had not been arrived five minutes the day beforewhen a full account of the whole had burst on her but still it mustbe talked of she must make enquiries she must regret the imprudencelament the result and captain wentworth's name must be mentioned by bothanne was conscious of not doing it so well as lady russellshe could not speak the name and look straight forward tolady russell's eye till she had adopted the expedient of telling herbriefly what she thought of the attachment between him and louisawhen this was told his name distressed her no longerlady russell had only to listen composedly and wish them happybut internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure in pleased contemptthat the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhatof the value of an anne elliot should eight years afterwardsbe charmed by a louisa musgrovethe first three or four days passed most quietly with no circumstanceto mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from lymewhich found their way to anne she could not tell how and broughta rather improving account of louisa  at the end of that periodlady russell's politeness could repose no longer and the fainterself-threatenings of the past became in a decided tonei must call on mrs croft i really must call upon her soonanne have you courage to go with me and pay a visit in that houseit will be some trial to us bothanne did not shrink from it on the contrary she truly felt as she saidin observing--i think you are very likely to suffer the most of the twoyour feelings are less reconciled to the change than mineby remaining in the neighbourhood i am become inured to itshe could have said more on the subject for she had in factso high an opinion of the crofts and considered her fatherso very fortunate in his tenants felt the parish to be so sureof a good example and the poor of the best attention and reliefthat however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removalshe could not but in conscience feel that they were gonewho deserved not to stay and that kellynch hall had passedinto better hands than its owners'  these convictions must unquestionablyhave their own pain and severe was its kind but they precludedthat pain which lady russell would suffer in entering the house againand returning through the well-known apartmentsin such moments anne had no power of saying to herselfthese rooms ought to belong only to us  oh how fallenin their destination!  how unworthily occupied!  an ancient familyto be so driven away!  strangers filling their place!no except when she thought of her mother and remembered whereshe had been used to sit and preside she had no sigh of that descriptionto heavemrs croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasureof fancying herself a favourite and on the present occasionreceiving her in that house there was particular attentionthe sad accident at lyme was soon the prevailing topicand on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid it appearedthat each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermornthat captain wentworth had been in kellynch yesterday the first timesince the accident had brought anne the last note which she hadnot been able to trace the exact steps of had staid a few hoursand then returned again to lyme and without any present intentionof quitting it any more  he had enquired after her she foundparticularly had expressed his hope of miss elliot's not beingthe worse for her exertions and had spoken of those exertions as greatthis was handsome and gave her more pleasure than almost anything elsecould have doneas to the sad catastrophe itself it could be canvassed only in one styleby a couple of steady sensible women whose judgements had to workon ascertained events and it was perfectly decided that it had beenthe consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudencethat its effects were most alarming and that it was frightful to thinkhow long miss musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful and how liableshe would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!the admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--ay a very bad business indeed  a new sort of way thisfor a young fellow to be making love by breaking his mistress's headis not it miss elliot  this is breaking a head and giving a plastertruly!admiral croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit lady russellbut they delighted anne  his goodness of heart and simplicityof character were irresistiblenow this must be very bad for you said he suddenly rousing froma little reverie to be coming and finding us here  i had notrecollected it before i declare but it must be very badbut now do not stand upon ceremony  get up and go over all the roomsin the house if you like itanother time sir i thank you not nowwell whenever it suits you  you can slip in from the shrubberyat any time and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging upby that door  a good place is not it  but checking himselfyou will not think it a good place for yours were always keptin the butler's room  ay so it always is i believeone man's ways may be as good as another's but we all like our own bestand so you must judge for yourself whether it would be better for youto go about the house or notanne finding she might decline it did so very gratefullywe have made very few changes either continued the admiralafter thinking a moment  very few  we told you about the laundry-doorat uppercross  that has been a very great improvementthe wonder was how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenienceof its opening as it did so long!  you will tell sir walterwhat we have done and that mr shepherd thinks it the greatest improvementthe house ever had  indeed i must do ourselves the justice to saythat the few alterations we have made have been all very muchfor the better  my wife should have the credit of them howeveri have done very little besides sending away some of the largelooking-glasses from my dressing-room which was your father'sa very good man and very much the gentleman i am surebut i should think miss elliot looking with serious reflectioni should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of lifesuch a number of looking-glasses! oh lord! there was no getting awayfrom one's self  so i got sophy to lend me a hand and we soonshifted their quarters and now i am quite snug with mylittle shaving glass in one corner and another great thingthat i never go nearanne amused in spite of herself was rather distressed for an answerand the admiral fearing he might not have been civil enoughtook up the subject again to say--the next time you write to your good father miss elliotpray give him my compliments and mrs croft's and say that we aresettled here quite to our liking and have no fault at all to findwith the place  the breakfast-room chimney smokes a littlei grant you but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hardwhich may not happen three times a winter  and take it altogethernow that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judgethere is not one that we like better than this  pray say sowith my compliments  he will be glad to hear itlady russell and mrs croft were very well pleased with each otherbut the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceedfar at present for when it was returned the crofts announcedthemselves to be going away for a few weeks to visit their connexionsin the north of the county and probably might not be at home againbefore lady russell would be removing to bathso ended all danger to anne of meeting captain wentworth at kellynch hallor of seeing him in company with her friend  everything was safe enoughand she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wastedon the subjectchapter 14though charles and mary had remained at lyme much longer aftermr and mrs musgrove's going than anne conceived they could have beenat all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home againand as soon as possible after their return to uppercrossthey drove over to the lodge  they had left louisa beginning to sit upbut her head though clear was exceedingly weak and her nervessusceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness and thoughshe might be pronounced to be altogether doing very wellit was still impossible to say when she might be able to bearthe removal home and her father and mother who must returnin time to receive their younger children for the christmas holidayshad hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with themthey had been all in lodgings together  mrs musgrove hadgot mrs harville's children away as much as she could every possiblesupply from uppercross had been furnished to lighten the inconvenienceto the harvilles while the harvilles had been wanting themto come to dinner every day and in short it seemed to have beenonly a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterestedand hospitablemary had had her evils but upon the whole as was evidentby her staying so long she had found more to enjoy than to suffercharles hayter had been at lyme oftener than suited her and whenthey dined with the harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to waitand at first mrs harville had always given mrs musgrove precedencebut then she had received so very handsome an apology from heron finding out whose daughter she was and there had been so muchgoing on every day there had been so many walks between their lodgingsand the harvilles and she had got books from the libraryand changed them so often that the balance had certainly beenmuch in favour of lyme  she had been taken to charmouth tooand she had bathed and she had gone to church and there were a great manymore people to look at in the church at lyme than at uppercrossand all this joined to the sense of being so very usefulhad made really an agreeable fortnightanne enquired after captain benwick mary's face was clouded directlycharles laughedoh! captain benwick is very well i believe but he isa very odd young man  i do not know what he would be atwe asked him to come home with us for a day or two  charles undertookto give him some shooting and he seemed quite delighted and for my parti thought it was all settled when behold! on tuesday nighthe made a very awkward sort of excuse `he never shot' and he had`been quite misunderstood' and he had promised this and he hadpromised that and the end of it was i found that he did not mean to comei suppose he was afraid of finding it dull but upon my wordi should have thought we were lively enough at the cottagefor such a heart-broken man as captain benwickcharles laughed again and said now mary you know very wellhow it really was  it was all your doing turning to annehe fancied that if he went with us he should find you close byhe fancied everybody to be living in uppercross and when he discoveredthat lady russell lived three miles off his heart failed himand he had not courage to come  that is the fact upon my honourmary knows it isbut mary did not give into it very graciously whether fromnot considering captain benwick entitled by birth and situationto be in love with an elliot or from not wanting to believeanne a greater attraction to uppercross than herself must beleft to be guessed  anne's good-will however was not to be lessenedby what she heard  she boldly acknowledged herself flatteredand continued her enquiriesoh! he talks of you cried charles in such terms--mary interrupted him i declare charles i never heard himmention anne twice all the time i was there  i declare annehe never talks of you at allno admitted charles i do not know that he ever does in a generalway but however it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedinglyhis head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendationand he wants to talk to you about them he has found out something or otherin one of them which he thinks--oh! i cannot pretend to remember itbut it was something very fine--i overheard him telling henriettaall about it and then `miss elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms!now mary i declare it was so i heard it myself and you werein the other room  `elegance sweetness beauty' oh! there was no endof miss elliot's charmsand i am sure cried mary warmly it was a very little to his creditif he did  miss harville only died last june  such a heartis very little worth having is it lady russell  i am sureyou will agree with mei must see captain benwick before i decide said lady russell smilingand that you are very likely to do very soon i can tell you ma'amsaid charles  though he had not nerves for coming away with usand setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit herehe will make his way over to kellynch one day by himselfyou may depend on it  i told him the distance and the roadand i told him of the church's being so very well worth seeingfor as he has a taste for those sort of things i thought that wouldbe a good excuse and he listened with all his understanding and souland i am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soonso i give you notice lady russellany acquaintance of anne's will always be welcome to mewas lady russell's kind answeroh! as to being anne's acquaintance said mary i think he is rathermy acquaintance for i have been seeing him every day this last fortnightwell as your joint acquaintance then i shall be very happyto see captain benwickyou will not find anything very agreeable in him i assure you ma'amhe is one of the dullest young men that ever lived  he has walked with mesometimes from one end of the sands to the other without saying a wordhe is not at all a well-bred young man  i am sure you will not like himthere we differ mary said anne  i think lady russell would like himi think she would be so much pleased with his mind that she wouldvery soon see no deficiency in his mannerso do i anne said charles  i am sure lady russell would like himhe is just lady russell's sort  give him a book and he willread all day longyes that he will! exclaimed mary tauntingly  he will sit poringover his book and not know when a person speaks to him or when onedrop's one's scissors or anything that happens  do you thinklady russell would like thatlady russell could not help laughing  upon my word said shei should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could haveadmitted of such difference of conjecture steady and matter of factas i may call myself  i have really a curiosity to see the personwho can give occasion to such directly opposite notionsi wish he may be induced to call here  and when he does maryyou may depend upon hearing my opinion but i am determinednot to judge him beforehandyou will not like him i will answer for itlady russell began talking of something else  mary spoke with animationof their meeting with or rather missing mr elliot so extraordinarilyhe is a man said lady russell whom i have no wish to seehis declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his familyhas left a very strong impression in his disfavour with methis decision checked mary's eagerness and stopped her shortin the midst of the elliot countenancewith regard to captain wentworth though anne hazarded no enquiriesthere was voluntary communication sufficient  his spirits had beengreatly recovering lately as might be expected  as louisa improvedhe had improved and he was now quite a different creaturefrom what he had been the first week  he had not seen louisaand was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to herfrom an interview that he did not press for it at all andon the contrary seemed to have a plan of going away for a weekor ten days till her head was stronger  he had talked of goingdown to plymouth for a week and wanted to persuade captain benwickto go with him but as charles maintained to the last captain benwickseemed much more disposed to ride over to kellynchthere can be no doubt that lady russell and anne were bothoccasionally thinking of captain benwick from this timelady russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it mightbe his herald nor could anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgencein her father's grounds or any visit of charity in the villagewithout wondering whether she might see him or hear of himcaptain benwick came not however  he was either less disposed for itthan charles had imagined or he was too shy and after giving hima week's indulgence lady russell determined him to be unworthyof the interest which he had been beginning to excitethe musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from schoolbringing with them mrs harville's little children to improve the noiseof uppercross and lessen that of lyme  henrietta remained with louisabut all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarterslady russell and anne paid their compliments to them oncewhen anne could not but feel that uppercross was already quite alive againthough neither henrietta nor louisa nor charles hayternor captain wentworth were there the room presented as strong a contrastas could be wished to the last state she had seen it inimmediately surrounding mrs musgrove were the little harvilleswhom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two childrenfrom the cottage expressly arrived to amuse them  on one sidewas a table occupied by some chattering girls cutting up silkand gold paper and on the other were tressels and traysbending under the weight of brawn and cold pies where riotous boyswere holding high revel the whole completed by a roaring christmas firewhich seemed determined to be heard in spite of all the noiseof the others  charles and mary also came in of courseduring their visit and mr musgrove made a point of paying his respectsto lady russell and sat down close to her for ten minutestalking with a very raised voice but from the clamour of the childrenon his knees generally in vain  it was a fine family-pieceanne judging from her own temperament would have deemedsuch a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerveswhich louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken  but mrs musgrovewho got anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordiallyagain and again for all her attentions to them concludeda short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observingwith a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone throughnothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulnessat homelouisa was now recovering apace  her mother could even think of herbeing able to join their party at home before her brothers and sisterswent to school again  the harvilles had promised to come with herand stay at uppercross whenever she returned  captain wentworth was gonefor the present to see his brother in shropshirei hope i shall remember in future said lady russell as soon asthey were reseated in the carriage not to call at uppercrossin the christmas holidayseverybody has their taste in noises as well as in other mattersand sounds are quite innoxious or most distressing by their sortrather than their quantity  when lady russell not long afterwardswas entering bath on a wet afternoon and driving throughthe long course of streets from the old bridge to camden placeamidst the dash of other carriages the heavy rumble of carts and draysthe bawling of newspapermen muffin-men and milkmen and the ceaselessclink of pattens she made no complaint  no these were noiseswhich belonged to the winter pleasures her spirits roseunder their influence and like mrs musgrove she was feelingthough not saying that after being long in the country nothing could beso good for her as a little quiet cheerfulnessanne did not share these feelings  she persisted in a very determinedthough very silent disinclination for bath caught the first dim viewof the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wishof seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to behowever disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see herwhen she arrived  and looked back with fond regret to the bustlesof uppercross and the seclusion of kellynchelizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interestmr elliot was in bath  he had called in camden place had calleda second time a third had been pointedly attentive  if elizabethand her father did not deceive themselves had been taking much painsto seek the acquaintance and proclaim the value of the connectionas he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect  this was very wonderfulif it were true and lady russell was in a state of very agreeablecuriosity and perplexity about mr elliot already recanting the sentimentshe had so lately expressed to mary of his being a man whom she hadno wish to see  she had a great wish to see him  if he really soughtto reconcile himself like a dutiful branch he must be forgivenfor having dismembered himself from the paternal treeanne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstancebut she felt that she would rather see mr elliot again than notwhich was more than she could say for many other persons in bathshe was put down in camden place and lady russell then droveto her own lodgings in rivers streetchapter 15sir walter had taken a very good house in camden placea lofty dignified situation such as becomes a man of consequenceand both he and elizabeth were settled there much to their satisfactionanne entered it with a sinking heart anticipating an imprisonmentof many months and anxiously saying to herself oh! when shall ileave you again  a degree of unexpected cordiality howeverin the welcome she received did her good  her father and sisterwere glad to see her for the sake of shewing her the house and furnitureand met her with kindness  her making a fourth when theysat down to dinner was noticed as an advantagemrs clay was very pleasant and very smiling but her courtesies and smileswere more a matter of course  anne had always felt that she wouldpretend what was proper on her arrival but the complaisance of the otherswas unlooked for  they were evidently in excellent spiritsand she was soon to listen to the causes  they had no inclinationto listen to her  after laying out for some compliments of beingdeeply regretted in their old neighbourhood which anne could not paythey had only a few faint enquiries to make before the talk must beall their own  uppercross excited no interest kellynch very littleit was all baththey had the pleasure of assuring her that bath more than answeredtheir expectations in every respect  their house was undoubtedlythe best in camden place their drawing-rooms had many decided advantagesover all the others which they had either seen or heard ofand the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-upor the taste of the furniture  their acquaintance wasexceedingly sought after  everybody was wanting to visit themthey had drawn back from many introductions and still wereperpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothinghere were funds of enjoyment  could anne wonder that her fatherand sister were happy  she might not wonder but she must sighthat her father should feel no degradation in his change should seenothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholdershould find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a townand she must sigh and smile and wonder too as elizabeth threw openthe folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-roomto the other boasting of their space at the possibility of that womanwho had been mistress of kellynch hall finding extent to be proud ofbetween two walls perhaps thirty feet asunderbut this was not all which they had to make them happythey had mr elliot too  anne had a great deal to hear of mr elliothe was not only pardoned they were delighted with himhe had been in bath about a fortnight he had passed through bathin november in his way to london when the intelligence ofsir walter's being settled there had of course reached himthough only twenty-four hours in the place but he had not been ableto avail himself of it but he had now been a fortnight in bathand his first object on arriving had been to leave his cardin camden place following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meetand when they did meet by such great openness of conductsuch readiness to apologize for the past such solicitude to be receivedas a relation again that their former good understandingwas completely re-establishedthey had not a fault to find in him  he had explained awayall the appearance of neglect on his own side  it had originatedin misapprehension entirely  he had never had an idea ofthrowing himself off he had feared that he was thrown offbut knew not why and delicacy had kept him silent  upon the hintof having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the familyand the family honours he was quite indignant  he who had ever boastedof being an elliot and whose feelings as to connectionwere only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present dayhe was astonished indeed but his character and general conductmust refute it  he could refer sir walter to all who knew himand certainly the pains he had been taking on this the first opportunityof reconciliation to be restored to the footing of a relationand heir-presumptive was a strong proof of his opinions on the subjectthe circumstances of his marriage too were found to admit ofmuch extenuation  this was an article not to be entered on by himselfbut a very intimate friend of his a colonel wallis a highlyrespectable man perfectly the gentleman and not an ill-looking mansir walter added who was living in very good style in marlboroughbuildings and had at his own particular request been admittedto their acquaintance through mr elliot had mentioned one or two thingsrelative to the marriage which made a material differencein the discredit of itcolonel wallis had known mr elliot long had been well acquaintedalso with his wife had perfectly understood the whole storyshe was certainly not a woman of family but well educatedaccomplished rich and excessively in love with his friendthere had been the charm  she had sought him  without that attractionnot all her money would have tempted elliot and sir walter wasmoreover assured of her having been a very fine womanhere was a great deal to soften the business  a very fine womanwith a large fortune in love with him!  sir walter seemed to admit itas complete apology and though elizabeth could not see the circumstancein quite so favourable a light she allowed it be a great extenuationmr elliot had called repeatedly had dined with them onceevidently delighted by the distinction of being asked for theygave no dinners in general delighted in short by every proofof cousinly notice and placing his whole happiness in beingon intimate terms in camden placeanne listened but without quite understanding it  allowanceslarge allowances she knew must be made for the ideas of those who spokeshe heard it all under embellishment  all that sounded extravagantor irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no originbut in the language of the relators  still however she hadthe sensation of there being something more than immediately appearedin mr elliot's wishing after an interval of so many yearsto be well received by them  in a worldly view he had nothing to gainby being on terms with sir walter nothing to risk by a state of variancein all probability he was already the richer of the twoand the kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the titlea sensible man and he had looked like a very sensible manwhy should it be an object to him  she could only offer one solutionit was perhaps for elizabeth's sake  there might really have beena liking formerly though convenience and accident had drawn hima different way and now that he could afford to please himselfhe might mean to pay his addresses to her  elizabeth was certainlyvery handsome with well-bred elegant manners and her charactermight never have been penetrated by mr elliot knowing her but in publicand when very young himself  how her temper and understandingmight bear the investigation of his present keener time of lifewas another concern and rather a fearful one  most earnestly did she wishthat he might not be too nice or too observant if elizabethwere his object and that elizabeth was disposed to believe herself soand that her friend mrs clay was encouraging the idea seemed apparentby a glance or two between them while mr elliot's frequent visitswere talked ofanne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at lyme but withoutbeing much attended to  oh! yes perhaps it had been mr elliotthey did not know  it might be him perhaps  they could not listento her description of him  they were describing him themselvessir walter especially  he did justice to his very gentlemanlikeappearance his air of elegance and fashion his good shaped facehis sensible eye but at the same time must lament his beingvery much under-hung a defect which time seemed to have increasednor could he pretend to say that ten years had not alteredalmost every feature for the worse  mr elliot appeared to thinkthat he sir walter was looking exactly as he had done whenthey last parted but sir walter had not been able to returnthe compliment entirely which had embarrassed him  he did not meanto complain however  mr elliot was better to look at than most menand he had no objection to being seen with him anywheremr elliot and his friends in marlborough buildings were talked ofthe whole evening  colonel wallis had been so impatient to beintroduced to them! and mr elliot so anxious that he should!and there was a mrs wallis at present known only to them by descriptionas she was in daily expectation of her confinement but mr elliotspoke of her as a most charming woman quite worthy of being knownin camden place and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquaintedsir walter thought much of mrs wallis she was said to bean excessively pretty woman beautiful  he longed to see herhe hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faceshe was continually passing in the streets  the worst of bath wasthe number of its plain women  he did not mean to say that there wereno pretty women but the number of the plain was out of all proportionhe had frequently observed as he walked that one handsome facewould be followed by thirty or five-and-thirty frights and onceas he had stood in a shop on bond street he had countedeighty-seven women go by one after another without there beinga tolerable face among them  it had been a frosty morningto be sure a sharp frost which hardly one woman in a thousandcould stand the test of  but still there certainly werea dreadful multitude of ugly women in bath and as for the men!they were infinitely worse  such scarecrows as the streets were full of!it was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anythingtolerable by the effect which a man of decent appearance producedhe had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with colonel walliswho was a fine military figure though sandy-haired without observingthat every woman's eye was upon him every woman's eye was sure to beupon colonel wallis  modest sir walter!  he was not allowedto escape however  his daughter and mrs clay united in hintingthat colonel wallis's companion might have as good a figureas colonel wallis and certainly was not sandy-hairedhow is mary looking said sir walter in the height of his good humourthe last time i saw her she had a red nose but i hope that may nothappen every dayoh! no that must have been quite accidental  in general she has beenin very good health and very good looks since michaelmasif i thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp windsand grow coarse i would send her a new hat and pelisseanne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gownor a cap would not be liable to any such misuse when a knock at the doorsuspended everything  a knock at the door! and so late!it was ten o'clock  could it be mr elliot  they knew he was to dinein lansdown crescent  it was possible that he might stop in his way hometo ask them how they did  they could think of no one elsemrs clay decidedly thought it mr elliot's knock  mrs clay was rightwith all the state which a butler and foot-boy could givemr elliot was ushered into the roomit was the same the very same man with no difference but of dressanne drew a little back while the others received his complimentsand her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hourbut he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither shenor her friend had taken cold the day before &c &c which wasall as politely done and as politely taken as possible but her partmust follow then  sir walter talked of his youngest daughtermr elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughterthere was no occasion for remembering mary and anne smiling andblushing very becomingly shewed to mr elliot the pretty featureswhich he had by no means forgotten and instantly saw with amusementat his little start of surprise that he had not been at all awareof who she was  he looked completely astonished but not more astonishedthan pleased his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrityhe welcomed the relationship alluded to the past and entreatedto be received as an acquaintance already  he was quite as good-lookingas he had appeared at lyme his countenance improved by speakingand his manners were so exactly what they ought to be so polishedso easy so particularly agreeable that she could compare themin excellence to only one person's manners  they were not the samebut they were perhaps equally goodhe sat down with them and improved their conversation very muchthere could be no doubt of his being a sensible man  ten minuteswere enough to certify that  his tone his expressionshis choice of subject his knowing where to stop it was allthe operation of a sensible discerning mind  as soon as he couldhe began to talk to her of lyme wanting to compare opinionsrespecting the place but especially wanting to speak of the circumstanceof their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same timeto give his own route understand something of hers and regret thathe should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to hershe gave him a short account of her party and business at lymehis regret increased as he listened  he had spent his wholesolitary evening in the room adjoining theirs had heard voicesmirth continually thought they must be a most delightful set of peoplelonged to be with them but certainly without the smallest suspicionof his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himselfif he had but asked who the party were!  the name of musgrove wouldhave told him enough  well it would serve to cure him ofan absurd practice of never asking a question at an innwhich he had adopted when quite a young man on the principalof its being very ungenteel to be curiousthe notions of a young man of one or two and twenty said heas to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thingare more absurd i believe than those of any other set of beingsin the world  the folly of the means they often employis only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in viewbut he must not be addressing his reflections to anne alonehe knew it he was soon diffused again among the othersand it was only at intervals that he could return to lymehis enquiries however produced at length an account of the sceneshe had been engaged in there soon after his leaving the placehaving alluded to an accident  he must hear the wholewhen he questioned sir walter and elizabeth began to question alsobut the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfeltshe could only compare mr elliot to lady russell in the wishof really comprehending what had passed and in the degree of concernfor what she must have suffered in witnessing ithe staid an hour with them  the elegant little clock on the mantel-piece had struck eleven with its silver sounds and the watchmanwas beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same talebefore mr elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there longanne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening incamden place could have passed so well!chapter 16there was one point which anne on returning to her familywould have been more thankful to ascertain even than mr elliot'sbeing in love with elizabeth which was her father's not beingin love with mrs clay and she was very far from easy about itwhen she had been at home a few hours  on going down to breakfastthe next morning she found there had just been a decent pretenceon the lady's side of meaning to leave them  she could imagine mrs clayto have said that now miss anne was come she could not suppose herselfat all wanted for elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisperthat must not be any reason indeed  i assure you i feel it noneshe is nothing to me compared with you  and she was in full timeto hear her father say my dear madam this must not be  as yetyou have seen nothing of bath  you have been here only to be usefulyou must not run away from us now  you must stay to be acquaintedwith mrs wallis the beautiful mrs wallis  to your fine mindi well know the sight of beauty is a real gratificationhe spoke and looked so much in earnest that anne was not surprisedto see mrs clay stealing a glance at elizabeth and herselfher countenance perhaps might express some watchfulnessbut the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thoughtin her sister  the lady could not but yield to such joint entreatiesand promise to stayin the course of the same morning anne and her father chancing to bealone together he began to compliment her on her improved lookshe thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skinher complexion greatly improved clearer fresher  had she beenusing any thing in particular  no nothing  merely gowlandhe supposed  no nothing at all  ha! he was surprised at thatand added certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you areyou cannot be better than well or i should recommend gowlandthe constant use of gowland during the spring months  mrs clay has beenusing it at my recommendation and you see what it has done for heryou see how it has carried away her frecklesif elizabeth could but have heard this!  such personal praisemight have struck her especially as it did not appear to annethat the freckles were at all lessened  but everything musttake its chance  the evil of a marriage would be much diminishedif elizabeth were also to marry  as for herself she might alwayscommand a home with lady russelllady russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trialon this point in her intercourse in camden place  the sight of mrs clayin such favour and of anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocationto her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in bathwho drinks the water gets all the new publications and hasa very large acquaintance has time to be vexedas mr elliot became known to her she grew more charitableor more indifferent towards the others  his manners werean immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she foundthe solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at firstas she told anne almost ready to exclaim can this be mr elliotand could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeableor estimable man  everything united in him good understandingcorrect opinions knowledge of the world and a warm hearthe had strong feelings of family attachment and family honourwithout pride or weakness he lived with the liberality of a man of fortunewithout display he judged for himself in everything essentialwithout defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorumhe was steady observant moderate candid never run away with by spiritsor by selfishness which fancied itself strong feeling and yetwith a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely and a valuefor all the felicities of domestic life which characters offancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possessshe was sure that he had not been happy in marriage  colonel wallissaid it and lady russell saw it but it had been no unhappinessto sour his mind nor she began pretty soon to suspect to prevent histhinking of a second choice  her satisfaction in mr elliotoutweighed all the plague of mrs clayit was now some years since anne had begun to learn that sheand her excellent friend could sometimes think differentlyand it did not surprise her therefore that lady russellshould see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to requiremore motives than appeared in mr elliot's great desire of a reconciliationin lady russell's view it was perfectly natural that mr elliotat a mature time of life should feel it a most desirable objectand what would very generally recommend him among all sensible peopleto be on good terms with the head of his family the simplest processin the world of time upon a head naturally clear and only erringin the heyday of youth  anne presumed however still to smile about itand at last to mention elizabeth  lady russell listened and lookedand made only this cautious reply--elizabeth! very welltime will explainit was a reference to the future which anne after a little observationfelt she must submit to  she could determine nothing at presentin that house elizabeth must be first and she was in the habitof such general observance as miss elliot that any particularityof attention seemed almost impossible  mr elliot tooit must be remembered had not been a widower seven monthsa little delay on his side might be very excusable  in factanne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing thatshe was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginationsfor though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existedso many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recoveryfrom the awful impression of its being dissolvedhowever it might end he was without any question theirpleasantest acquaintance in bath  she saw nobody equal to himand it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about lymewhich he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more ofas herself  they went through the particulars of their first meetinga great many times  he gave her to understand that he hadlooked at her with some earnestness  she knew it welland she remembered another person's look alsothey did not always think alike  his value for rank and connexionshe perceived was greater than hers  it was not merely complaisanceit must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmlyinto her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject whichshe thought unworthy to excite them  the bath paper one morningannounced the arrival of the dowager viscountess dalrympleand her daughter the honourable miss carteret and all the comfortof no-- camden place was swept away for many days for the dalrymplesin anne's opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the elliotsand the agony was how to introduce themselves properlyanne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobilityand she must acknowledge herself disappointed  she had hopedbetter things from their high ideas of their own situation in lifeand was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseena wish that they had more pride for our cousins lady dalrympleand miss carteret our cousins the dalrymples sounded in her earsall day longsir walter had once been in company with the late viscountbut had never seen any of the rest of the family and the difficultiesof the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourseby letters of ceremony ever since the death of that said late viscountwhen in consequence of a dangerous illness of sir walter'sat the same time there had been an unlucky omission at kellynchno letter of condolence had been sent to ireland  the neglecthad been visited on the head of the sinner for when poor lady elliotdied herself no letter of condolence was received at kellynchand consequently there was but too much reason to apprehendthat the dalrymples considered the relationship as closedhow to have this anxious business set to rights and be admittedas cousins again was the question  and it was a question whichin a more rational manner neither lady russell nor mr elliotthought unimportant  family connexions were always worth preservinggood company always worth seeking lady dalrymple had taken a housefor three months in laura place and would be living in styleshe had been at bath the year before and lady russell had heard herspoken of as a charming woman  it was very desirable thatthe connexion should be renewed if it could be done without anycompromise of propriety on the side of the elliotssir walter however would choose his own means and at last wrotea very fine letter of ample explanation regret and entreatyto his right honourable cousin  neither lady russell nor mr elliotcould admire the letter but it did all that was wantedin bringing three lines of scrawl from the dowager viscountessshe was very much honoured and should be happy in their acquaintancethe toils of the business were over the sweets began  they visitedin laura place they had the cards of dowager viscountess dalrympleand the honourable miss carteret to be arranged wherever they mightbe most visible  and our cousins in laura place--our cousinlady dalrymple and miss carteret were talked of to everybodyanne was ashamed  had lady dalrymple and her daughter even beenvery agreeable she would still have been ashamed of the agitationthey created but they were nothing  there was no superiority of manneraccomplishment or understanding  lady dalrymple had acquiredthe name of a charming woman because she had a smile and a civil answerfor everybody  miss carteret with still less to say was so plainand so awkward that she would never have been tolerated in camden placebut for her birthlady russell confessed she had expected something better but yetit was an acquaintance worth having and when anne ventured to speakher opinion of them to mr elliot he agreed to their being nothingin themselves but still maintained that as a family connexionas good company as those who would collect good company around themthey had their value  anne smiled and saidmy idea of good company mr elliot is the company of cleverwell-informed people who have a great deal of conversationthat is what i call good companyyou are mistaken said he gently that is not good companythat is the best  good company requires only birth educationand manners and with regard to education is not very nicebirth and good manners are essential but a little learning isby no means a dangerous thing in good company on the contraryit will do very well  my cousin anne shakes her headshe is not satisfied  she is fastidious  my dear cousinsitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidiousthan almost any other woman i know but will it answerwill it make you happy  will it not be wiser to accept the societyof those good ladies in laura place and enjoy all the advantagesof the connexion as far as possible  you may depend upon itthat they will move in the first set in bath this winterand as rank is rank your being known to be related to themwill have its use in fixing your family our family let me sayin that degree of consideration which we must all wish foryes sighed anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them!then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she addedi certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble takento procure the acquaintance  i suppose smiling i have more pridethan any of you but i confess it does vex me that we should beso solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged which we maybe very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to thempardon me dear cousin you are unjust in your own claimsin london perhaps in your present quiet style of livingit might be as you say  but in bath sir walter elliot and his familywill always be worth knowing  always acceptable as acquaintancewell said anne i certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcomewhich depends so entirely upon placei love your indignation said he it is very naturalbut here you are in bath and the object is to be established herewith all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to sir walter elliotyou talk of being proud i am called proud i know and i shall not wishto believe myself otherwise for our pride if investigatedwould have the same object i have no doubt though the kind may seema little different  in one point i am sure my dear cousinhe continued speaking lower though there was no one else in the roomin one point i am sure we must feel alike  we must feel thatevery addition to your father's society among his equals or superiorsmay be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath himhe looked as he spoke to the seat which mrs clay had beenlately occupying  a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meantand though anne could not believe in their having the same sort of prideshe was pleased with him for not liking mrs clay and her conscienceadmitted that his wishing to promote her father's gettinggreat acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating herchapter 17while sir walter and elizabeth were assiduously pushing theirgood fortune in laura place anne was renewing an acquaintanceof a very different descriptionshe had called on her former governess and had heard from herof there being an old school-fellow in bath who had the two strong claimson her attention of past kindness and present suffering  miss hamiltonnow mrs smith had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her lifewhen it had been most valuable  anne had gone unhappy to schoolgrieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly lovedfeeling her separation from home and suffering as a girl of fourteenof strong sensibility and not high spirits must suffer at such a timeand miss hamilton three years older than herself but still from the wantof near relations and a settled home remaining another year at schoolhad been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessenedher misery and could never be remembered with indifferencemiss hamilton had left school had married not long afterwardswas said to have married a man of fortune and this was allthat anne had known of her till now that their governess's accountbrought her situation forward in a more decided but very different formshe was a widow and poor  her husband had been extravagantand at his death about two years before had left his affairsdreadfully involved  she had had difficulties of every sortto contend with and in addition to these distresses had been afflictedwith a severe rheumatic fever which finally settling in her legshad made her for the present a cripple  she had come to bathon that account and was now in lodgings near the hot bathsliving in a very humble way unable even to afford herselfthe comfort of a servant and of course almost excluded from societytheir mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visitfrom miss elliot would give mrs smith and anne thereforelost no time in going  she mentioned nothing of what she had heardor what she intended at home  it would excite no proper interest thereshe only consulted lady russell who entered thoroughly into her sentimentsand was most happy to convey her as near to mrs smith's lodgingsin westgate buildings as anne chose to be takenthe visit was paid their acquaintance re-established their interestin each other more than re-kindled  the first ten minuteshad its awkwardness and its emotion  twelve years were gonesince they had parted and each presented a somewhat different personfrom what the other had imagined  twelve years had changed annefrom the blooming silent unformed girl of fifteen to the elegantlittle woman of seven-and-twenty with every beauty except bloomand with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentleand twelve years had transformed the fine-looking well-grown miss hamiltonin all the glow of health and confidence of superiority into a poorinfirm helpless widow receiving the visit of her former protegeeas a favour but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soonpassed away and left only the interesting charm of rememberingformer partialities and talking over old timesanne found in mrs smith the good sense and agreeable manners whichshe had almost ventured to depend on and a disposition to converseand be cheerful beyond her expectation  neither the dissipationsof the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictionsof the present neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to haveclosed her heart or ruined her spiritsin the course of a second visit she talked with great opennessand anne's astonishment increased  she could scarcely imaginea more cheerless situation in itself than mrs smith's  she had beenvery fond of her husband  she had buried him  she had beenused to affluence  it was gone  she had no child to connect herwith life and happiness again no relations to assist in the arrangementof perplexed affairs no health to make all the rest supportableher accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour and a dark bedroombehind with no possibility of moving from one to the other withoutassistance which there was only one servant in the house to affordand she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bathyet in spite of all this anne had reason to believe that she hadmoments only of languor and depression to hours of occupationand enjoyment  how could it be  she watched observed reflectedand finally determined that this was not a case of fortitudeor of resignation only  a submissive spirit might be patienta strong understanding would supply resolution but here was something morehere was that elasticity of mind that disposition to be comfortedthat power of turning readily from evil to good and of finding employmentwhich carried her out of herself which was from nature aloneit was the choicest gift of heaven and anne viewed her friendas one of those instances in which by a merciful appointmentit seems designed to counterbalance almost every other wantthere had been a time mrs smith told her when her spiritshad nearly failed  she could not call herself an invalid nowcompared with her state on first reaching bath  then she had indeedbeen a pitiable object for she had caught cold on the journeyand had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was againconfined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant painand all this among strangers with the absolute necessity of havinga regular nurse and finances at that moment particularly unfitto meet any extraordinary expense  she had weathered it howeverand could truly say that it had done her good  it had increasedher comforts by making her feel herself to be in good handsshe had seen too much of the world to expect sudden or disinterestedattachment anywhere but her illness had proved to her that her landladyhad a character to preserve and would not use her ill and she had beenparticularly fortunate in her nurse as a sister of her landladya nurse by profession and who had always a home in that housewhen unemployed chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend herand she said mrs smith besides nursing me most admirablyhas really proved an invaluable acquaintance  as soon as i coulduse my hands she taught me to knit which has been a great amusementand she put me in the way of making these little thread-casespin-cushions and card-racks which you always find me so busy aboutand which supply me with the means of doing a little goodto one or two very poor families in this neighbourhoodshe had a large acquaintance of course professionally among thosewho can afford to buy and she disposes of my merchandiseshe always takes the right time for applying  everybody's heart is openyou know when they have recently escaped from severe painor are recovering the blessing of health and nurse rookethoroughly understands when to speak  she is a shrewd intelligentsensible woman  hers is a line for seeing human nature and she hasa fund of good sense and observation which as a companion make herinfinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received`the best education in the world' know nothing worth attending tocall it gossip if you will but when nurse rooke has half an hour'sleisure to bestow on me she is sure to have something to relatethat is entertaining and profitable  something that makes oneknow one's species better  one likes to hear what is going onto be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and sillyto me who live so much alone her conversation i assure you is a treatanne far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure repliedi can easily believe it  women of that class have great opportunitiesand if they are intelligent may be well worth listening tosuch varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!and it is not merely in its follies that they are well readfor they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can bemost interesting or affecting  what instances must pass before themof ardent disinterested self-denying attachment of heroism fortitudepatience resignation  of all the conflicts and all the sacrificesthat ennoble us most  a sick chamber may often furnishthe worth of volumesyes said mrs smith more doubtingly sometimes it maythough i fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describehere and there human nature may be great in times of trialbut generally speaking it is its weakness and not its strengththat appears in a sick chamber  it is selfishness and impatiencerather than generosity and fortitude that one hears ofthere is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunatelyspeaking low and tremulously there are so many who forgetto think seriously till it is almost too lateanne saw the misery of such feelings  the husband had not beenwhat he ought and the wife had been led among that part of mankindwhich made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deservedit was but a passing emotion however with mrs smith she shook it offand soon added in a different tone--i do not suppose the situation my friend mrs rooke is in at presentwill furnish much either to interest or edify me  she is only nursingmrs wallis of marlborough buildings a mere pretty silly expensivefashionable woman i believe and of course will have nothing to reportbut of lace and finery  i mean to make my profit of mrs wallis howevershe has plenty of money and i intend she shall buy allthe high-priced things i have in hand nowanne had called several times on her friend before the existenceof such a person was known in camden place  at last it became necessaryto speak of her sir walter elizabeth and mrs clay returned one morningfrom laura place with a sudden invitation from lady dalrymplefor the same evening and anne was already engaged to spend that eveningin westgate buildings  she was not sorry for the excusethey were only asked she was sure because lady dalrymple beingkept at home by a bad cold was glad to make use of the relationshipwhich had been so pressed on her and she declined on her own accountwith great alacrity--she was engaged to spend the eveningwith an old schoolfellow  they were not much interested in anythingrelative to anne but still there were questions enough askedto make it understood what this old schoolfellow was and elizabethwas disdainful and sir walter severewestgate buildings! said he and who is miss anne elliotto be visiting in westgate buildings  a mrs smith  a widow mrs smithand who was her husband  one of five thousand mr smiths whose namesare to be met with everywhere  and what is her attractionthat she is old and sickly  upon my word miss anne elliotyou have the most extraordinary taste!  everything that revoltsother people low company paltry rooms foul air disgusting associationsare inviting to you  but surely you may put off this old ladytill to-morrow  she is not so near her end i presumebut that she may hope to see another day  what is her age  fortyno sir she is not one-and-thirty but i do not think i canput off my engagement because it is the only evening for some timewhich will at once suit her and myself  she goes into the warm bathto-morrow and for the rest of the week you know we are engagedbut what does lady russell think of this acquaintance asked elizabethshe sees nothing to blame in it replied anne on the contraryshe approves it and has generally taken me when i havecalled on mrs smithwestgate buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearanceof a carriage drawn up near its pavement observed sir waltersir henry russell's widow indeed has no honours to distinguish her armsbut still it is a handsome equipage and no doubt is well knownto convey a miss elliot  a widow mrs smith lodging in westgate buildings!a poor widow barely able to live between thirty and fortya mere mrs smith an every-day mrs smith of all people and all namesin the world to be the chosen friend of miss anne elliotand to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobilityof england and ireland!  mrs smith!  such a name!mrs clay who had been present while all this passed now thought itadvisable to leave the room and anne could have said muchand did long to say a little in defence of her friend'snot very dissimilar claims to theirs but her sense of personal respectto her father prevented her  she made no reply  she left itto himself to recollect that mrs smith was not the only widowin bath between thirty and forty with little to live onand no surname of dignityanne kept her appointment the others kept theirs and of courseshe heard the next morning that they had had a delightful eveningshe had been the only one of the set absent for sir walterand elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselvesbut had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting othersand had been at the trouble of inviting both lady russell and mr elliotand mr elliot had made a point of leaving colonel wallis earlyand lady russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagementsin order to wait on her  anne had the whole history of all thatsuch an evening could supply from lady russell  to herits greatest interest must be in having been very much talked ofbetween her friend and mr elliot in having been wished for regrettedand at the same time honoured for staying away in such a causeher kind compassionate visits to this old schoolfellowsick and reduced seemed to have quite delighted mr elliothe thought her a most extraordinary young woman in her temper mannersmind a model of female excellence  he could meet even lady russellin a discussion of her merits and anne could not be given to understandso much by her friend could not know herself to be so highly ratedby a sensible man without many of those agreeable sensationswhich her friend meant to createlady russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of mr elliotshe was as much convinced of his meaning to gain anne in time as ofhis deserving her and was beginning to calculate the number of weekswhich would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhoodand leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasingshe would not speak to anne with half the certainty she felt on the subjectshe would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafterof a possible attachment on his side of the desirableness of the alliancesupposing such attachment to be real and returned  anne heard herand made no violent exclamations she only smiled blushedand gently shook her headi am no match-maker as you well know said lady russellbeing much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human eventsand calculations  i only mean that if mr elliot should some time hencepay his addresses to you and if you should be disposed to accept himi think there would be every possibility of your being happy togethera most suitable connection everybody must consider it but i thinkit might be a very happy onemr elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man and in many respectsi think highly of him said anne but we should not suitlady russell let this pass and only said in rejoinder i own thatto be able to regard you as the future mistress of kellynchthe future lady elliot to look forward and see you occupyingyour dear mother's place succeeding to all her rightsand all her popularity as well as to all her virtues would bethe highest possible gratification to me  you are your mother's selfin countenance and disposition and if i might be allowed to fancy yousuch as she was in situation and name and home presiding and blessingin the same spot and only superior to her in being more highly valued!my dearest anne it would give me more delight than is often feltat my time of life!anne was obliged to turn away to rise to walk to a distant tableand leaning there in pretended employment try to subdue the feelingsthis picture excited  for a few moments her imagination and her heartwere bewitched  the idea of becoming what her mother had beenof having the precious name of lady elliot first revived in herselfof being restored to kellynch calling it her home againher home for ever was a charm which she could not immediately resistlady russell said not another word willing to leave the matterto its own operation and believing that could mr elliot at that momentwith propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed in shortwhat anne did not believe  the same image of mr elliot speakingfor himself brought anne to composure again  the charm of kellynchand of lady elliot all faded away  she never could accept himand it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any mansave one her judgement on a serious consideration of the possibilitiesof such a case was against mr elliotthough they had now been acquainted a month she could not be satisfiedthat she really knew his character  that he was a sensible manan agreeable man that he talked well professed good opinionsseemed to judge properly and as a man of principle this was allclear enough  he certainly knew what was right nor could she fixon any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed but yet she wouldhave been afraid to answer for his conduct  she distrusted the pastif not the present  the names which occasionally droptof former associates the allusions to former practices and pursuitssuggested suspicions not favourable of what he had beenshe saw that there had been bad habits that sunday travellinghad been a common thing that there had been a period of his lifeand probably not a short one when he had been at leastcareless in all serious matters and though he might now thinkvery differently who could answer for the true sentiments of a clevercautious man grown old enough to appreciate a fair characterhow could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansedmr elliot was rational discreet polished but he was not openthere was never any burst of feeling any warmth of indignation or delightat the evil or good of others  this to anne was a decided imperfectionher early impressions were incurable  she prized the frankthe open-hearted the eager character beyond all otherswarmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still  she felt that she couldso much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes lookedor said a careless or a hasty thing than of those whose presence of mindnever varied whose tongue never slippedmr elliot was too generally agreeable  various as were the tempersin her father's house he pleased them all  he endured too wellstood too well with every body  he had spoken to her with somedegree of openness of mrs clay had appeared completely to seewhat mrs clay was about and to hold her in contempt and yetmrs clay found him as agreeable as any bodylady russell saw either less or more than her young friendfor she saw nothing to excite distrust  she could not imaginea man more exactly what he ought to be than mr elliot nor did sheever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receivethe hand of her beloved anne in kellynch church in the course ofthe following autumnchapter 18it was the beginning of february and anne having been a month in bathwas growing very eager for news from uppercross and lymeshe wanted to hear much more than mary had communicatedit was three weeks since she had heard at all  she only knewthat henrietta was at home again and that louisa though considered to berecovering fast was still in lyme and she was thinking of them allvery intently one evening when a thicker letter than usual from marywas delivered to her and to quicken the pleasure and surprisewith admiral and mrs croft's complimentsthe crofts must be in bath!  a circumstance to interest herthey were people whom her heart turned to very naturallywhat is this cried sir walter  the crofts have arrived in baththe crofts who rent kellynch  what have they brought youa letter from uppercross cottage siroh! those letters are convenient passports  they secure an introductioni should have visited admiral croft however at any ratei know what is due to my tenantanne could listen no longer she could not even have told howthe poor admiral's complexion escaped her letter engrossed herit had been begun several days back            february 1stmy dear anne--i make no apology for my silence because i knowhow little people think of letters in such a place as bathyou must be a great deal too happy to care for uppercross whichas you well know affords little to write about  we have hada very dull christmas mr and mrs musgrove have not had one dinner partyall the holidays  i do not reckon the hayters as anybodythe holidays however are over at last  i believe no children ever hadsuch long ones  i am sure i had not  the house was cleared yesterdayexcept of the little harvilles but you will be surprised to hearthey have never gone home  mrs harville must be an odd motherto part with them so long  i do not understand it  they arenot at all nice children in my opinion but mrs musgrove seems tolike them quite as well if not better than her grandchildrenwhat dreadful weather we have had!  it may not be felt in bathwith your nice pavements but in the country it is of some consequencei have not had a creature call on me since the second week in januaryexcept charles hayter who had been calling much oftener than was welcomebetween ourselves i think it a great pity henrietta did not remain at lymeas long as louisa it would have kept her a little out of his waythe carriage is gone to-day to bring louisa and the harvilles to-morrowwe are not asked to dine with them however till the day aftermrs musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journeywhich is not very likely considering the care that will be taken of herand it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrowi am glad you find mr elliot so agreeable and wish i could be acquaintedwith him too but i have my usual luck  i am always out of the waywhen any thing desirable is going on always the last of my familyto be noticed  what an immense time mrs clay has been stayingwith elizabeth!  does she never mean to go away  but perhapsif she were to leave the room vacant we might not be invitedlet me know what you think of this  i do not expect my childrento be asked you know  i can leave them at the great house very wellfor a month or six weeks  i have this moment heard that the croftsare going to bath almost immediately they think the admiral goutycharles heard it quite by chance they have not had the civilityto give me any notice or of offering to take anythingi do not think they improve at all as neighbours  we see nothing of themand this is really an instance of gross inattention  charles joins mein love and everything proper  yours affectionately  mary m---i am sorry to say that i am very far from well and jemima hasjust told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throatvery much about  i dare say i shall catch it and my sore-throatsyou know are always worse than anybody'sso ended the first part which had been afterwards put into an envelopecontaining nearly as much morei kept my letter open that i might send you word how louisabore her journey and now i am extremely glad i did having a great dealto add  in the first place i had a note from mrs croft yesterdayoffering to convey anything to you a very kind friendly note indeedaddressed to me just as it ought i shall therefore be able tomake my letter as long as i like  the admiral does not seem very illand i sincerely hope bath will do him all the good he wantsi shall be truly glad to have them back again  our neighbourhoodcannot spare such a pleasant family  but now for louisai have something to communicate that will astonish you not a littleshe and the harvilles came on tuesday very safely and in the eveningwe went to ask her how she did when we were rather surprisednot to find captain benwick of the party for he had been invitedas well as the harvilles and what do you think was the reasonneither more nor less than his being in love with louisaand not choosing to venture to uppercross till he had had an answerfrom mr musgrove for it was all settled between him and herbefore she came away and he had written to her father by captain harvilletrue upon my honour!  are not you astonished  i shall be surprisedat least if you ever received a hint of it for i never didmrs musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matterwe are all very well pleased however for though it is not equal to hermarrying captain wentworth it is infinitely better than charles hayterand mr musgrove has written his consent and captain benwickis expected to-day  mrs harville says her husband feels a good dealon his poor sister's account but however louisa is a great favouritewith both  indeed mrs harville and i quite agree that we love herthe better for having nursed her  charles wonders what captain wentworthwill say but if you remember i never thought him attached to louisai never could see anything of it  and this is the end you seeof captain benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yourshow charles could take such a thing into his head was alwaysincomprehensible to me  i hope he will be more agreeable nowcertainly not a great match for louisa musgrove but a million times betterthan marrying among the haytersmary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree preparedfor the news  she had never in her life been more astonishedcaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  it was almost too wonderfulfor belief and it was with the greatest effort that she could remainin the room preserve an air of calmness and answer the common questionsof the moment  happily for her they were not many  sir walterwanted to know whether the crofts travelled with four horsesand whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of bathas it might suit miss elliot and himself to visit in but hadlittle curiosity beyondhow is mary said elizabeth and without waiting for an answerand pray what brings the crofts to baththey come on the admiral's account  he is thought to be goutygout and decrepitude! said sir walter  poor old gentlemanhave they any acquaintance here asked elizabethi do not know but i can hardly suppose that at admiral croft'stime of life and in his profession he should not have many acquaintancein such a place as thisi suspect said sir walter coolly that admiral croftwill be best known in bath as the renter of kellynch hallelizabeth may we venture to present him and his wife in laura placeoh no! i think not  situated as we are with lady dalrymple cousinswe ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintanceshe might not approve  if we were not related it would not signifybut as cousins she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ourswe had better leave the crofts to find their own levelthere are several odd-looking men walking about here whoi am told are sailors  the crofts will associate with themthis was sir walter and elizabeth's share of interest in the letterwhen mrs clay had paid her tribute of more decent attentionin an enquiry after mrs charles musgrove and her fine little boysanne was at libertyin her own room she tried to comprehend it  well might charles wonderhow captain wentworth would feel!  perhaps he had quitted the fieldhad given louisa up had ceased to love had found he did not love hershe could not endure the idea of treachery or levity or anythingakin to ill usage between him and his friend  she could not endurethat such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairlycaptain benwick and louisa musgrove!  the high-spiritedjoyous-talking louisa musgrove and the dejected thinkingfeeling reading captain benwick seemed each of them everythingthat would not suit the other  their minds most dissimilar!where could have been the attraction  the answer soon presented itselfit had been in situation  they had been thrown together several weeksthey had been living in the same small family party  since henrietta'scoming away they must have been depending almost entirely on each otherand louisa just recovering from illness had been in an interesting stateand captain benwick was not inconsolable  that was a point which annehad not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawingthe same conclusion as mary from the present course of eventsthey served only to confirm the idea of his having felt somedawning of tenderness toward herself  she did not mean howeverto derive much more from it to gratify her vanity than marymight have allowed  she was persuaded that any tolerably pleasingyoung woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would havereceived the same compliment  he had an affectionate hearthe must love somebodyshe saw no reason against their being happy  louisa had finenaval fervour to begin with and they would soon grow more alikehe would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiastfor scott and lord byron nay that was probably learnt alreadyof course they had fallen in love over poetry  the idea oflouisa musgrove turned into a person of literary tasteand sentimental reflection was amusing but she had no doubtof its being so  the day at lyme the fall from the cobbmight influence her health her nerves her courage her character tothe end of her life as thoroughly as it appeared to haveinfluenced her fatethe conclusion of the whole was that if the woman who had been sensibleof captain wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another manthere was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonderand if captain wentworth lost no friend by it certainly nothingto be regretted  no it was not regret which made anne's heartbeat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheekswhen she thought of captain wentworth unshackled and freeshe had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigatethey were too much like joy senseless joy!she longed to see the crofts but when the meeting took placeit was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached themthe visit of ceremony was paid and returned and louisa musgrovewas mentioned and captain benwick too without even half a smilethe crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in gay streetperfectly to sir walter's satisfaction  he was not at all ashamedof the acquaintance and did in fact think and talk a great deal moreabout the admiral than the admiral ever thought or talked about himthe crofts knew quite as many people in bath as they wished forand considered their intercourse with the elliots as a mere matter of formand not in the least likely to afford them any pleasurethey brought with them their country habit of being almost always togetherhe was ordered to walk to keep off the gout and mrs croftseemed to go shares with him in everything and to walkfor her life to do him good  anne saw them wherever she wentlady russell took her out in her carriage almost every morningand she never failed to think of them and never failed to see themknowing their feelings as she did it was a most attractive pictureof happiness to her  she always watched them as long as she coulddelighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking ofas they walked along in happy independence or equally delightedto see the admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encounteredan old friend and observe their eagerness of conversationwhen occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy mrs croftlooking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around heranne was too much engaged with lady russell to be often walking herselfbut it so happened that one morning about a week or ten daysafter the croft's arrival it suited her best to leave her friendor her friend's carriage in the lower part of the townand return alone to camden place and in walking up milsom streetshe had the good fortune to meet with the admiral  he was standingby himself at a printshop window with his hands behind himin earnest contemplation of some print and she not only might havepassed him unseen but was obliged to touch as well as address himbefore she could catch his notice  when he did perceive andacknowledge her however it was done with all his usual franknessand good humour  ha! is it you  thank you thank youthis is treating me like a friend  here i am you seestaring at a picture  i can never get by this shop without stoppingbut what a thing here is by way of a boat!  do look at itdid you ever see the like  what queer fellows your fine painters must beto think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapelessold cockleshell as that  and yet here are two gentlemenstuck up in it mightily at their ease and looking about them at the rocksand mountains as if they were not to be upset the next momentwhich they certainly must be  i wonder where that boat was built!laughing heartily i would not venture over a horsepond in itwell turning away now where are you bound  can i go anywherefor you

d'ye do' as we pass however  i shall not stop`how d'ye do'  brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wifeshe poor soul is tied by the leg  she has a blister on one of her heelsas large as a three-shilling piece  if you look across the streetyou will see admiral brand coming down and his brother  shabby fellowsboth of them!  i am glad they are not on this side of the waysophy cannot bear them  they played me a pitiful trick oncegot away with some of my best men  i will tell you the whole storyanother time  there comes old sir archibald drew and his grandsonlook he sees us he kisses his hand to you he takes you for my wifeah! the peace has come too soon for that younker  poor old sir archibald!how do you like bath miss elliot  it suits us very wellwe are always meeting with some old friend or other the streetsfull of them every morning sure to have plenty of chatand then we get away from them all and shut ourselves in our lodgingsand draw in our chairs and are snug as if we were at kellynchay or as we used to be even at north yarmouth and dealwe do not like our lodgings here the worse i can tell youfor putting us in mind of those we first had at north yarmouththe wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same waywhen they were got a little farther anne ventured to press againfor what he had to communicate  she hoped when clear of milsom streetto have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to waitfor the admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they hadgained the greater space and quiet of belmont and as she wasnot really mrs croft she must let him have his own wayas soon as they were fairly ascending belmont he began--well now you shall hear something that will surprise youbut first of all you must tell me the name of the young ladyi am going to talk about  that young lady you know that we haveall been so concerned for  the miss musgrove that all this has beenhappening to  her christian name  i always forget her christian nameanne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she reallydid but now she could safely suggest the name of louisaay ay miss louisa musgrove that is the name  i wish young ladieshad not such a number of fine christian names  i should never be outif they were all sophys or something of that sort  wellthis miss louisa we all thought you know was to marry frederickhe was courting her week after week  the only wonder waswhat they could be waiting for till the business at lyme camethen indeed it was clear enough that they must wait till her brainwas set to right  but even then there was something odd in theirway of going on  instead of staying at lyme he went off to plymouthand then he went off to see edward  when we came back from mineheadhe was gone down to edward's and there he has been ever sincewe have seen nothing of him since november  even sophy couldnot understand it  but now the matter has take the strangest turn of allfor this young lady the same miss musgrove instead of beingto marry frederick is to marry james benwick  you know james benwicka little  i am a little acquainted with captain benwickwell she is to marry him  nay most likely they are married alreadyfor i do not know what they should wait fori thought captain benwick a very pleasing young man said anneand i understand that he bears an excellent characteroh! yes yes there is not a word to be said against james benwickhe is only a commander it is true made last summer and these arebad times for getting on but he has not another fault that i know ofan excellent good-hearted fellow i assure you a very activezealous officer too which is more than you would think for perhapsfor that soft sort of manner does not do him justiceindeed you are mistaken there sir i should never augur want of spiritfrom captain benwick's manners  i thought them particularly pleasingand i will answer for it they would generally pleasewell well ladies are the best judges but james benwick is rather toopiano for me and though very likely it is all our partialitysophy and i cannot help thinking frederick's manners better than histhere is something about frederick more to our tasteanne was caught  she had only meant to oppose the too common ideaof spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each othernot at all to represent captain benwick's manners as the very bestthat could possibly be and after a little hesitationshe was beginning to say i was not entering into any comparisonof the two friends but the admiral interrupted her with--and the thing is certainly true  it is not a mere bit of gossipwe have it from frederick himself  his sister had a letterfrom him yesterday in which he tells us of it and he had just had itin a letter from harville written upon the spot from uppercrossi fancy they are all at uppercrossthis was an opportunity which anne could not resist she said thereforei hope admiral i hope there is nothing in the style of captainwentworth's letter to make you and mrs croft particularly uneasyit did seem last autumn as if there were an attachment between himand louisa musgrove but i hope it may be understood to have worn outon each side equally and without violence  i hope his letterdoes not breathe the spirit of an ill-used mannot at all not at all there is not an oath or a murmurfrom beginning to endanne looked down to hide her smileno no frederick is not a man to whine and complain he hastoo much spirit for that  if the girl likes another man betterit is very fit she should have himcertainly  but what i mean is that i hope there is nothingin captain wentworth's manner of writing to make you supposehe thinks himself ill-used by his friend which might appearyou know without its being absolutely said  i should be very sorrythat such a friendship as has subsisted between him and captain benwickshould be destroyed or even wounded by a circumstance of this sortyes yes i understand you  but there is nothing at all of that naturein the letter  he does not give the least fling at benwickdoes not so much as say `i wonder at it i have a reason of my ownfor wondering at it'  no you would not guess from his way of writingthat he had ever thought of this miss what's her name for himselfhe very handsomely hopes they will be happy together and there isnothing very unforgiving in that i thinkanne did not receive the perfect conviction which the admiral meantto convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farthershe therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quietattention and the admiral had it all his own waypoor frederick! said he at last  now he must begin all over againwith somebody else  i think we must get him to bath  sophy must writeand beg him to come to bath  here are pretty girls enough i am sureit would be of no use to go to uppercross again for that othermiss musgrove i find is bespoke by her cousin the young parsondo not you think miss elliot we had better try to get him to bathchapter 19while admiral croft was taking this walk with anne and expressinghis wish of getting captain wentworth to bath captain wentworthwas already on his way thither  before mrs croft had writtenhe was arrived and the very next time anne walked out she saw himmr elliot was attending his two cousins and mrs clay  they werein milsom street  it began to rain not much but enough tomake shelter desirable for women and quite enough to make itvery desirable for miss elliot to have the advantage of beingconveyed home in lady dalrymple's carriage which was seen waitingat a little distance she anne and mrs clay thereforeturned into molland's while mr elliot stepped to lady dalrympleto request her assistance  he soon joined them again successfulof course lady dalrymple would be most happy to take them homeand would call for them in a few minutesher ladyship's carriage was a barouche and did not holdmore than four with any comfort  miss carteret was with her motherconsequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodationfor all the three camden place ladies  there could be no doubtas to miss elliot  whoever suffered inconvenience she must suffer nonebut it occupied a little time to settle the point of civilitybetween the other two  the rain was a mere trifle and anne wasmost sincere in preferring a walk with mr elliot  but the rain was alsoa mere trifle to mrs clay she would hardly allow it even to drop at alland her boots were so thick! much thicker than miss anne'sand in short her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be leftto walk with mr elliot as anne could be and it was discussed between themwith a generosity so polite and so determined that the others wereobliged to settle it for them miss elliot maintaining that mrs clayhad a little cold already and mr elliot deciding on appealthat his cousin anne's boots were rather the thickestit was fixed accordingly that mrs clay should be of the partyin the carriage and they had just reached this point when anneas she sat near the window descried most decidedly and distinctlycaptain wentworth walking down the streether start was perceptible only to herself but she instantly felt thatshe was the greatest simpleton in the world the most unaccountableand absurd!  for a few minutes she saw nothing before herit was all confusion  she was lost and when she had scoldedback her senses she found the others still waiting for the carriageand mr elliot always obliging just setting off for union streeton a commission of mrs clay'sshe now felt a great inclination to go to the outer doorshe wanted to see if it rained  why was she to suspect herselfof another motive  captain wentworth must be out of sightshe left her seat she would go one half of her should not be alwaysso much wiser than the other half or always suspecting the otherof being worse than it was  she would see if it rainedshe was sent back however in a moment by the entrance ofcaptain wentworth himself among a party of gentlemen and ladiesevidently his acquaintance and whom he must have joineda little below milsom street  he was more obviously struckand confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed beforehe looked quite red  for the first time since their renewed acquaintanceshe felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the twoshe had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few momentsall the overpowering blinding bewildering first effectsof strong surprise were over with her  still howevershe had enough to feel!  it was agitation pain pleasurea something between delight and miseryhe spoke to her and then turned away  the character of his mannerwas embarrassment  she could not have called it either cold or friendlyor anything so certainly as embarrassedafter a short interval however he came towards her and spoke againmutual enquiries on common subjects passed  neither of them probablymuch the wiser for what they heard and anne continuing fully sensibleof his being less at ease than formerly  they had by dint of beingso very much together got to speak to each other with a considerableportion of apparent indifference and calmness but he could not do it nowtime had changed him or louisa had changed him  there was consciousnessof some sort or other  he looked very well not as if he had beensuffering in health or spirits and he talked of uppercrossof the musgroves nay even of louisa and had even a momentary lookof his own arch significance as he named her but yet it wascaptain wentworth not comfortable not easy not able to feign that he wasit did not surprise but it grieved anne to observe that elizabethwould not know him  she saw that he saw elizabeth that elizabeth saw himthat there was complete internal recognition on each sideshe was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintanceexpecting it and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn awaywith unalterable coldnesslady dalrymple's carriage for which miss elliot was growingvery impatient now drew up the servant came in to announce itit was beginning to rain again and altogether there was a delayand a bustle and a talking which must make all the little crowdin the shop understand that lady dalrymple was calling to conveymiss elliot  at last miss elliot and her friend unattended butby the servant for there was no cousin returned were walking offand captain wentworth watching them turned again to anneand by manner rather than words was offering his services to heri am much obliged to you was her answer but i am not going with themthe carriage would not accommodate so many  i walk  i prefer walkingbut it rainsoh! very little  nothing that i regardafter a moment's pause he said  though i came only yesterdayi have equipped myself properly for bath already you seepointing to a new umbrella i wish you would make use of itif you are determined to walk though i think it would be more prudentto let me get you a chairshe was very much obliged to him but declined it all repeatingher conviction that the rain would come to nothing at presentand adding i am only waiting for mr elliot  he will be here in a momenti am sureshe had hardly spoken the words when mr elliot walked incaptain wentworth recollected him perfectly  there was no differencebetween him and the man who had stood on the steps at lymeadmiring anne as she passed except in the air and look and mannerof the privileged relation and friend  he came in with eagernessappeared to see and think only of her apologised for his staywas grieved to have kept her waiting and anxious to get her awaywithout further loss of time and before the rain increasedand in another moment they walked off together her arm under hisa gentle and embarrassed glance and a good morning to you!being all that she had time for as she passed awayas soon as they were out of sight the ladies of captain wentworth's partybegan talking of themmr elliot does not dislike his cousin i fancyoh! no that is clear enough  one can guess what will happen therehe is always with them half lives in the family i believewhat a very good-looking man!yes and miss atkinson who dined with him once at the wallisessays he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company withshe is pretty i think anne elliot very pretty when one comesto look at her  it is not the fashion to say so but i confessi admire her more than her sisteroh! so do iand so do i  no comparison  but the men are all wild after miss elliotanne is too delicate for themanne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin if he would havewalked by her side all the way to camden place without saying a wordshe had never found it so difficult to listen to him though nothingcould exceed his solicitude and care and though his subjectswere principally such as were wont to be always interestingpraise warm just and discriminating of lady russelland insinuations highly rational against mrs clay  but just nowshe could think only of captain wentworth  she could not understandhis present feelings whether he were really suffering muchfrom disappointment or not and till that point were settledshe could not be quite herselfshe hoped to be wise and reasonable in time but alas! alas!she must confess to herself that she was not wise yetanother circumstance very essential for her to know was how longhe meant to be in bath he had not mentioned it or she could notrecollect it  he might be only passing through  but it was more probablethat he should be come to stay  in that case so liable as every body wasto meet every body in bath lady russell would in all likelihoodsee him somewhere  would she recollect him  how would it all beshe had already been obliged to tell lady russell that louisa musgrovewas to marry captain benwick  it had cost her something to encounterlady russell's surprise and now if she were by any chanceto be thrown into company with captain wentworth her imperfect knowledgeof the matter might add another shade of prejudice against himthe following morning anne was out with her friend and for the first hourin an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain but at lastin returning down pulteney street she distinguished himon the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in viewthe greater part of the street  there were many other men about himmany groups walking the same way but there was no mistaking himshe looked instinctively at lady russell but not from any mad ideaof her recognising him so soon as she did herself  no it wasnot to be supposed that lady russell would perceive him till theywere nearly opposite  she looked at her however from time to timeanxiously and when the moment approached which must point him outthough not daring to look again for her own countenance she knewwas unfit to be seen she was yet perfectly conscious oflady russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--of her being in short intently observing him  she could thoroughlycomprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over lady russell's mindthe difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes the astonishmentshe must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over himand in foreign climes and in active service too without robbing himof one personal grace!at last lady russell drew back her head  now how would shespeak of himyou will wonder said she what has been fixing my eye so longbut i was looking after some window-curtains which lady alicia andmrs frankland were telling me of last night  they describedthe drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on thisside of the way and this part of the street as being the handsomestand best hung of any in bath but could not recollect the exact numberand i have been trying to find out which it could be but i confessi can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their descriptionanne sighed and blushed and smiled in pity and disdaineither at her friend or herself  the part which provoked her mostwas that in all this waste of foresight and caution she should havelost the right moment for seeing whether he saw thema day or two passed without producing anything  the theatre or the roomswhere he was most likely to be were not fashionable enoughfor the elliots whose evening amusements were solely in theelegant stupidity of private parties in which they were gettingmore and more engaged and anne wearied of such a state of stagnationsick of knowing nothing and fancying herself stronger becauseher strength was not tried was quite impatient for the concert eveningit was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by lady dalrympleof course they must attend  it was really expected to be a good oneand captain wentworth was very fond of music  if she could only havea few minutes conversation with him again she fancied she shouldbe satisfied and as to the power of addressing him she felt all overcourage if the opportunity occurred  elizabeth had turned from himlady russell overlooked him her nerves were strengthenedby these circumstances she felt that she owed him attentionshe had once partly promised mrs smith to spend the evening with herbut in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it offwith the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrowmrs smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescenceby all means said she only tell me all about it when you do comewho is your partyanne named them all  mrs smith made no reply but when she wasleaving her said and with an expression half serious half archwell i heartily wish your concert may answer and do not fail meto-morrow if you can come for i begin to have a forebodingthat i may not have many more visits from youanne was startled and confused but after standing in a moment's suspensewas obliged and not sorry to be obliged to hurry awaychapter 20sir walter his two daughters and mrs clay were the earliestof all their party at the rooms in the evening and as lady dalrymplemust be waited for they took their station by one of the firesin the octagon room  but hardly were they so settled when the dooropened again and captain wentworth walked in alone  anne wasthe nearest to him and making yet a little advance she instantly spokehe was preparing only to bow and pass on but her gentle how do you dobrought him out of the straight line to stand near her and make enquiriesin return in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back groundtheir being in the back ground was a support to anne she knew nothingof their looks and felt equal to everything which she believedright to be donewhile they were speaking a whispering between her father and elizabethcaught her ear  she could not distinguish but she must guess the subjectand on captain wentworth's making a distant bow she comprehendedthat her father had judged so well as to give him thatsimple acknowledgement of acquaintance and she was just in timeby a side glance to see a slight curtsey from elizabeth herselfthis though late and reluctant and ungracious was yetbetter than nothing and her spirits improvedafter talking however of the weather and bath and the concerttheir conversation began to flag and so little was said at lastthat she was expecting him to go every moment but he did nothe seemed in no hurry to leave her and presently with renewed spiritwith a little smile a little glow he said--i have hardly seen you since our day at lyme  i am afraid you must havesuffered from the shock and the more from its not overpowering youat the timeshe assured him that she had notit was a frightful hour said he a frightful day! and hepassed his hand across his eyes as if the remembrance were stilltoo painful but in a moment half smiling again addedthe day has produced some effects however has had some consequenceswhich must be considered as the very reverse of frightfulwhen you had the presence of mind to suggest that benwick would bethe properest person to fetch a surgeon you could have little ideaof his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recoverycertainly i could have none  but it appears--i should hope it would bea very happy match  there are on both sides good principlesand good temperyes said he looking not exactly forward but there i thinkends the resemblance  with all my soul i wish them happy and rejoiceover every circumstance in favour of it  they have no difficultiesto contend with at home no opposition no caprice no delaysthe musgroves are behaving like themselves most honourably and kindlyonly anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfortall this is much very much in favour of their happinessmore than perhaps--he stopped  a sudden recollection seemed to occur and to give himsome taste of that emotion which was reddening anne's cheeksand fixing her eyes on the ground  after clearing his throat howeverhe proceeded thus--i confess that i do think there is a disparity too great a disparityand in a point no less essential than mind  i regard louisa musgroveas a very amiable sweet-tempered girl and not deficient in understandingbut benwick is something more  he is a clever man a reading manand i confess that i do consider his attaching himself to herwith some surprise  had it been the effect of gratitudehad he learnt to love her because he believed her to be preferring himit would have been another thing  but i have no reason to suppose it soit seems on the contrary to have been a perfectly spontaneousuntaught feeling on his side and this surprises me  a man like himin his situation! with a heart pierced wounded almost broken!fanny harville was a very superior creature and his attachment to herwas indeed attachment  a man does not recover from sucha devotion of the heart to such a woman  he ought not he does noteither from the consciousness however that his friend had recoveredor from other consciousness he went no farther and anne whoin spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been utteredand in spite of all the various noises of the room the almost ceaselessslam of the door and ceaseless buzz of persons walking throughhad distinguished every word was struck gratified confusedand beginning to breathe very quick and feel an hundred thingsin a moment  it was impossible for her to enter on such a subjectand yet after a pause feeling the necessity of speakingand having not the smallest wish for a total change she only deviatedso far as to say--you were a good while at lyme i thinkabout a fortnight  i could not leave it till louisa's doing wellwas quite ascertained  i had been too deeply concerned in the mischiefto be soon at peace  it had been my doing solely mineshe would not have been obstinate if i had not been weakthe country round lyme is very fine  i walked and rode a great dealand the more i saw the more i found to admirei should very much like to see lyme again said anneindeed!  i should not have supposed that you could have foundanything in lyme to inspire such a feeling  the horror and distressyou were involved in the stretch of mind the wear of spirits!i should have thought your last impressions of lyme must have beenstrong disgustthe last hours were certainly very painful replied annebut when pain is over the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasureone does not love a place the less for having suffered in itunless it has been all suffering nothing but suffering which wasby no means the case at lyme  we were only in anxiety and distressduring the last two hours and previously there had been a great dealof enjoyment  so much novelty and beauty! i have travelled so littlethat every fresh place would be interesting to me but there is real beautyat lyme and in short with a faint blush at some recollectionsaltogether my impressions of the place are very agreeableas she ceased the entrance door opened again and the very party appearedfor whom they were waiting  lady dalrymple lady dalrymplewas the rejoicing sound and with all the eagerness compatiblewith anxious elegance sir walter and his two ladies stepped forwardto meet her  lady dalrymple and miss carteret escorted by mr elliotand colonel wallis who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instantadvanced into the room  the others joined them and it wasa group in which anne found herself also necessarily includedshe was divided from captain wentworth  their interestingalmost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a timebut slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!she had learnt in the last ten minutes more of his feelingstowards louisa more of all his feelings than she dared to think ofand she gave herself up to the demands of the party to the needfulcivilities of the moment with exquisite though agitated sensationsshe was in good humour with all  she had received ideas whichdisposed her to be courteous and kind to all and to pity every oneas being less happy than herselfthe delightful emotions were a little subdued when on stepping backfrom the group to be joined again by captain wentworth she sawthat he was gone  she was just in time to see him turn intothe concert room  he was gone he had disappeared she felta moment's regret  but they should meet again  he would look for herhe would find her out before the evening were over and at presentperhaps it was as well to be asunder  she was in need ofa little interval for recollectionupon lady russell's appearance soon afterwards the whole partywas collected and all that remained was to marshal themselvesand proceed into the concert room and be of all the consequencein their power draw as many eyes excite as many whispersand disturb as many people as they couldvery very happy were both elizabeth and anne elliot as they walked inelizabeth arm in arm with miss carteret and looking on the broad backof the dowager viscountess dalrymple before her had nothing to wish forwhich did not seem within her reach and anne--but it would bean insult to the nature of anne's felicity to draw any comparisonbetween it and her sister's the origin of one all selfish vanityof the other all generous attachmentanne saw nothing thought nothing of the brilliancy of the roomher happiness was from within  her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowedbut she knew nothing about it  she was thinking only ofthe last half hour and as they passed to their seats her mind tooka hasty range over it  his choice of subjects his expressionsand still more his manner and look had been such as she could seein only one light  his opinion of louisa musgrove's inferiorityan opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give his wonderat captain benwick his feelings as to a first strong attachmentsentences begun which he could not finish his half averted eyesand more than half expressive glance all all declared that he hada heart returning to her at least that anger resentment avoidancewere no more and that they were succeeded not merely by friendshipand regard but by the tenderness of the past  yes some share ofthe tenderness of the past  she could not contemplate the changeas implying less  he must love herthese were thoughts with their attendant visions which occupiedand flurried her too much to leave her any power of observationand she passed along the room without having a glimpse of himwithout even trying to discern him  when their places were determined onand they were all properly arranged she looked round to seeif he should happen to be in the same part of the room but he was nother eye could not reach him and the concert being just openingshe must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler waythe party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benchesanne was among those on the foremost and mr elliot had manoeuvred so wellwith the assistance of his friend colonel wallis as to have a seat by hermiss elliot surrounded by her cousins and the principal objectof colonel wallis's gallantry was quite contentedanne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainmentof the evening it was just occupation enough  she had feelings forthe tender spirits for the gay attention for the scientificand patience for the wearisome and had never liked a concert betterat least during the first act  towards the close of itin the interval succeeding an italian song she explainedthe words of the song to mr elliot  they had a concert bill between themthis said she is nearly the sense or rather the meaning of the wordsfor certainly the sense of an italian love-song must not be talked ofbut it is as nearly the meaning as i can give for i do not pretendto understand the language  i am a very poor italian scholaryes yes i see you are  i see you know nothing of the matteryou have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sightthese inverted transposed curtailed italian lines into clearcomprehensible elegant english  you need not say anything moreof your ignorance  here is complete proofi will not oppose such kind politeness but i should be sorry to beexamined by a real proficienti have not had the pleasure of visiting in camden place so longreplied he without knowing something of miss anne elliotand i do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in generalto be aware of half her accomplishments and too highly accomplishedfor modesty to be natural in any other womanfor shame! for shame! this is too much flattery  i forget what we areto have next turning to the billperhaps said mr elliot speaking low i have had a longer acquaintancewith your character than you are aware ofindeed!  how so  you can have been acquainted with it only sincei came to bath excepting as you might hear me previously spoken ofin my own familyi knew you by report long before you came to bath  i had heard youdescribed by those who knew you intimately  i have been acquaintedwith you by character many years  your person your dispositionaccomplishments manner they were all present to memr elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raiseno one can withstand the charm of such a mystery  to have beendescribed long ago to a recent acquaintance by nameless peopleis irresistible and anne was all curiosity  she wonderedand questioned him eagerly but in vain  he delighted in being askedbut he would not tellno no some time or other perhaps but not now  he would mentionno names now but such he could assure her had been the facthe had many years ago received such a description of miss anne elliotas had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit and excitedthe warmest curiosity to know heranne could think of no one so likely to have spoken withpartiality of her many years ago as the mr wentworth of monkfordcaptain wentworth's brother  he might have been in mr elliot's companybut she had not courage to ask the questionthe name of anne elliot said he has long had an interesting sound to mevery long has it possessed a charm over my fancy and if i daredi would breathe my wishes that the name might never changesuch she believed were his words but scarcely had shereceived their sound than her attention was caught by other soundsimmediately behind her which rendered every thing else trivialher father and lady dalrymple were speakinga well-looking man said sir walter a very well-looking mana very fine young man indeed! said lady dalrymple  more airthan one often sees in bath  irish i dare sayno i just know his name  a bowing acquaintance  wentworthcaptain wentworth of the navy  his sister married my tenantin somersetshire the croft who rents kellynchbefore sir walter had reached this point anne's eyes had caughtthe right direction and distinguished captain wentworth standingamong a cluster of men at a little distance  as her eyes fell on himhis seemed to be withdrawn from her  it had that appearanceit seemed as if she had been one moment too late and as long as shedared observe he did not look again  but the performancewas recommencing and she was forced to seem to restore her attentionto the orchestra and look straight forwardwhen she could give another glance he had moved away  he could not havecome nearer to her if he would she was so surrounded and shut inbut she would rather have caught his eyemr elliot's speech too distressed her  she had no longerany inclination to talk to him  she wished him not so near herthe first act was over  now she hoped for some beneficial changeand after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party some of themdid decide on going in quest of tea  anne was one of the few whodid not choose to move  she remained in her seat and so did lady russellbut she had the pleasure of getting rid of mr elliot and she did not meanwhatever she might feel on lady russell's account to shrink fromconversation with captain wentworth if he gave her the opportunityshe was persuaded by lady russell's countenance that she had seen himhe did not come however  anne sometimes fancied she discerned himat a distance but he never came  the anxious intervalwore away unproductively  the others returned the room filled againbenches were reclaimed and repossessed and another hour of pleasureor of penance was to be sat out another hour of music was to givedelight or the gapes as real or affected taste for it prevailedto anne it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitationshe could not quit that room in peace without seeing captain wentworthonce more without the interchange of one friendly lookin re-settling themselves there were now many changes the result of whichwas favourable for her  colonel wallis declined sitting down againand mr elliot was invited by elizabeth and miss carteret in a mannernot to be refused to sit between them and by some other removalsand a little scheming of her own  anne was enabled to place herselfmuch nearer the end of the bench than she had been beforemuch more within reach of a passer-by  she could not do sowithout comparing herself with miss larolles the inimitable miss larollesbut still she did it and not with much happier effectthough by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdicationin her next neighbours she found herself at the very end of the benchbefore the concert closedsuch was her situation with a vacant space at hand when captain wentworthwas again in sight  she saw him not far off  he saw her tooyet he looked grave and seemed irresolute and only by very slow degreescame at last near enough to speak to her  she felt that somethingmust be the matter  the change was indubitable  the differencebetween his present air and what it had been in the octagon roomwas strikingly great  why was it  she thought of her fatherof lady russell  could there have been any unpleasant glanceshe began by speaking of the concert gravely more like the captainwentworth of uppercross owned himself disappointed had expected singingand in short must confess that he should not be sorry when it was overanne replied and spoke in defence of the performance so welland yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly that his countenanceimproved and he replied again with almost a smile  they talkedfor a few minutes more the improvement held he even looked downtowards the bench as if he saw a place on it well worth occupyingwhen at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged anne to turn roundit came from mr elliot  he begged her pardon but she must be applied toto explain italian again  miss carteret was very anxious to havea general idea of what was next to be sung  anne could not refusebut never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirita few minutes though as few as possible were inevitably consumedand when her own mistress again when able to turn and lookas she had done before she found herself accosted by captain wentworthin a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell  he must wish her good nighthe was going he should get home as fast as he couldis not this song worth staying for said anne suddenly struckby an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouragingno! he replied impressively there is nothing worth my staying forand he was gone directlyjealousy of mr elliot!  it was the only intelligible motivecaptain wentworth jealous of her affection!  could she have believed ita week ago three hours ago!  for a moment the gratification was exquisitebut alas! there were very different thoughts to succeedhow was such jealousy to be quieted  how was the truth to reach himhow in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situationswould he ever learn of her real sentiments  it was misery to thinkof mr elliot's attentions  their evil was incalculablechapter 21anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promiseof going to mrs smith meaning that it should engage her from homeat the time when mr elliot would be most likely to call for to avoidmr elliot was almost a first objectshe felt a great deal of good-will towards him  in spite ofthe mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regardperhaps compassion  she could not help thinking much of the extraordinarycircumstances attending their acquaintance of the right whichhe seemed to have to interest her by everything in situationby his own sentiments by his early prepossession  it was altogethervery extraordinary flattering but painful  there was much to regrethow she might have felt had there been no captain wentworth in the casewas not worth enquiry for there was a captain wentworthand be the conclusion of the present suspense good or badher affection would be his for ever  their union she believedcould not divide her more from other men than their final separationprettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancycould never have passed along the streets of bath than annewas sporting with from camden place to westgate buildingsit was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the wayshe was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morningparticularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected herthough it had been an appointmentan account of the concert was immediately claimed and anne's recollectionsof the concert were quite happy enough to animate her featuresand make her rejoice to talk of it  all that she could tellshe told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been thereand unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as mrs smith who hadalready heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiterrather more of the general success and produce of the eveningthan anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particularsof the company  everybody of any consequence or notoriety in bathwas well know by name to mrs smiththe little durands were there i conclude said she with their mouthsopen to catch the music like unfledged sparrows ready to be fedthey never miss a concertyes i did not see them myself but i heard mr elliot say they werein the roomthe ibbotsons were they there and the two new beautieswith the tall irish officer who is talked of for one of themi do not know  i do not think they wereold lady mary maclean  i need not ask after her  she never missesi know and you must have seen her  she must have been in your own circlefor as you went with lady dalrymple you were in the seats of grandeurround the orchestra of courseno that was what i dreaded  it would have been very unpleasant to mein every respect  but happily lady dalrymple always choosesto be farther off and we were exceedingly well placed that isfor hearing i must not say for seeing because i appear to have seenvery littleoh! you saw enough for your own amusement  i can understandthere is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowdand this you had  you were a large party in yourselvesand you wanted nothing beyondbut i ought to have looked about me more said anne consciouswhile she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking aboutthat the object only had been deficientno no you were better employed  you need not tell me that youhad a pleasant evening  i see it in your eye  i perfectly seehow the hours passed  that you had always something agreeableto listen to  in the intervals of the concert it was conversationanne half smiled and said do you see that in my eyeyes i do  your countenance perfectly informs me that you werein company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeablein the world the person who interests you at this present timemore than all the rest of the world put togethera blush overspread anne's cheeks  she could say nothingand such being the case continued mrs smith after a short pausei hope you believe that i do know how to value your kindnessin coming to me this morning  it is really very good of youto come and sit with me when you must have so many pleasanter demandsupon your timeanne heard nothing of this  she was still in the astonishment andconfusion excited by her friend's penetration unable to imaginehow any report of captain wentworth could have reached herafter another short silence--pray said mrs smith is mr elliot aware of your acquaintance with medoes he know that i am in bathmr elliot! repeated anne looking up surprised  a moment's reflectionshewed her the mistake she had been under  she caught it instantaneouslyand recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon addedmore composedly are you acquainted with mr ellioti have been a good deal acquainted with him replied mrs smith gravelybut it seems worn out now  it is a great while since we meti was not at all aware of this  you never mentioned it beforehad i known it i would have had the pleasure of talking to him about youto confess the truth said mrs smith assuming her usualair of cheerfulness that is exactly the pleasure i want you to havei want you to talk about me to mr elliot  i want your interest with himhe can be of essential service to me and if you would have the goodnessmy dear miss elliot to make it an object to yourselfof course it is donei should be extremely happy i hope you cannot doubt my willingnessto be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspectthat you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliota greater right to influence him than is really the casei am sure you have somehow or other imbibed such a notionyou must consider me only as mr elliot's relation  if in that lightthere is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of himi beg you would not hesitate to employ memrs smith gave her a penetrating glance and then smiling said--i have been a little premature i perceive i beg your pardoni ought to have waited for official information  but now my dearmiss elliot as an old friend do give me a hint as to when i may speaknext week  to be sure by next week i may be allowed tothink it all settled and build my own selfish schemes onmr elliot's good fortuneno replied anne nor next week nor next nor nexti assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking ofwill be settled any week  i am not going to marry mr ellioti should like to know why you imagine i ammrs smith looked at her again looked earnestly smiledshook her head and exclaimed--now how i do wish i understood you!  how i do wish i knewwhat you were at!  i have a great idea that you do not design to be cruelwhen the right moment occurs  till it does come you knowwe women never mean to have anybody  it is a thing of course among usthat every man is refused till he offers  but why should you be cruellet me plead for my--present friend i cannot call him but formy former friend  where can you look for a more suitable matchwhere could you expect a more gentlemanlike agreeable manlet me recommend mr elliot  i am sure you hear nothing but good of himfrom colonel wallis and who can know him better than colonel wallismy dear mrs smith mr elliot's wife has not been dead much abovehalf a year  he ought not to be supposed to be paying his addressesto any oneoh! if these are your only objections cried mrs smith archlymr elliot is safe and i shall give myself no more trouble about himdo not forget me when you are married that's all  let him know me to bea friend of yours and then he will think little of the trouble requiredwhich it is very natural for him now with so many affairs and engagementsof his own to avoid and get rid of as he can very natural perhapsninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same  of coursehe cannot be aware of the importance to me  well my dear miss ellioti hope and trust you will be very happy  mr elliot has senseto understand the value of such a woman  your peace will not beshipwrecked as mine has been  you are safe in all worldly mattersand safe in his character  he will not be led astray he will not bemisled by others to his ruinno said anne i can readily believe all that of my cousinhe seems to have a calm decided temper not at all opento dangerous impressions  i consider him with great respecti have no reason from any thing that has fallen within my observationto do otherwise  but i have not known him long and he is not a mani think to be known intimately soon  will not this mannerof speaking of him mrs smith convince you that he is nothing to mesurely this must be calm enough  and upon my word he is nothing to meshould he ever propose to me which i have very little reason to imaginehe has any thought of doing i shall not accept him  i assure youi shall not  i assure you mr elliot had not the share whichyou have been supposing in whatever pleasure the concertof last night might afford  not mr elliot it is not mr elliot that--she stopped regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so muchbut less would hardly have been sufficient  mrs smith would hardlyhave believed so soon in mr elliot's failure but from the perceptionof there being a somebody else  as it was she instantly submittedand with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and anneeager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why mrs smithshould have fancied she was to marry mr elliot where she could havereceived the idea or from whom she could have heard itdo tell me how it first came into your headit first came into my head replied mrs smith upon finding how muchyou were together and feeling it to be the most probable thingin the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of youand you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of youin the same way  but i never heard it spoken of till two days agoand has it indeed been spoken ofdid you observe the woman who opened the door to you whenyou called yesterdayno  was not it mrs speed as usual or the maid  i observedno one in particularit was my friend mrs rooke nurse rooke who by-the-byehad a great curiosity to see you and was delighted to be in the wayto let you in  she came away from marlborough buildings only on sundayand she it was who told me you were to marry mr elliotshe had had it from mrs wallis herself which did not seem bad authorityshe sat an hour with me on monday evening and gave me the whole historythe whole history repeated anne laughing  she could not makea very long history i think of one such little articleof unfounded newsmrs smith said nothingbut continued anne presently though there is no truth in my havingthis claim on mr elliot i should be extremely happy to be of use to youin any way that i could  shall i mention to him your being in bathshall i take any messageno i thank you  no certainly not  in the warmth of the momentand under a mistaken impression i might perhaps have endeavouredto interest you in some circumstances but not now  no i thank youi have nothing to trouble you withi think you spoke of having known mr elliot many yearsi didnot before he was married i supposeyes he was not married when i knew him firstand--were you much acquaintedintimatelyindeed!  then do tell me what he was at that time of lifei have a great curiosity to know what mr elliot was as a very young manwas he at all such as he appears nowi have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith's answergiven so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject fartherand anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiositythey were both silent  mrs smith very thoughtful  at last--i beg your pardon my dear miss elliot she cried in hernatural tone of cordiality i beg your pardon for the short answersi have been giving you but i have been uncertain what i ought to doi have been doubting and considering as to what i ought to tell youthere were many things to be taken into the account  one hatesto be officious to be giving bad impressions making mischiefeven the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preservingthough there may be nothing durable beneath  however i have determinedi think i am right i think you ought to be made acquaintedwith mr elliot's real character  though i fully believe thatat present you have not the smallest intention of accepting himthere is no saying what may happen  you might some time or otherbe differently affected towards him  hear the truth thereforenow while you are unprejudiced  mr elliot is a man without heartor conscience a designing wary cold-blooded being who thinksonly of himself whom for his own interest or ease would be guiltyof any cruelty or any treachery that could be perpetrated withoutrisk of his general character  he has no feeling for othersthose whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruinhe can neglect and desert without the smallest compunctionhe is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassionoh! he is black at heart hollow and black!anne's astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pauseand in a calmer manner she addedmy expressions startle you  you must allow for an injured angry womanbut i will try to command myself  i will not abuse himi will only tell you what i have found him  facts shall speakhe was the intimate friend of my dear husband who trusted and loved himand thought him as good as himself  the intimacy had been formedbefore our marriage  i found them most intimate friends and i toobecame excessively pleased with mr elliot and entertainedthe highest opinion of him  at nineteen you know one does notthink very seriously but mr elliot appeared to me quite as good as othersand much more agreeable than most others and we were almostalways together  we were principally in town living in very good stylehe was then the inferior in circumstances he was then the poor onehe had chambers in the temple and it was as much as he could doto support the appearance of a gentleman  he had always a homewith us whenever he chose it he was always welcome he was like a brothermy poor charles who had the finest most generous spirit in the worldwould have divided his last farthing with him and i know that his pursewas open to him i know that he often assisted himthis must have been about that very period of mr elliot's lifesaid anne which has always excited my particular curiosityit must have been about the same time that he became known tomy father and sister  i never knew him myself i only heard of himbut there was a something in his conduct then with regard tomy father and sister and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriagewhich i never could quite reconcile with present times  it seemedto announce a different sort of mani know it all i know it all cried mrs smith  he had beenintroduced to sir walter and your sister before i was acquainted with himbut i heard him speak of them for ever  i know he was invitedand encouraged and i know he did not choose to go  i can satisfy youperhaps on points which you would little expect and as to his marriagei knew all about it at the time  i was privy to all the fors and againstsi was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans and thoughi did not know his wife previously her inferior situation in societyindeed rendered that impossible yet i knew her all her life afterwardsor at least till within the last two years of her life and can answerany question you may wish to putnay said anne i have no particular enquiry to make about heri have always understood they were not a happy couple  but i shouldlike to know why at that time of his life he should slightmy father's acquaintance as he did  my father was certainly disposedto take very kind and proper notice of him  why did mr elliot draw backmr elliot replied mrs smith at that period of his lifehad one object in view  to make his fortune and by a rather quickerprocess than the law  he was determined to make it by marriagehe was determined at least not to mar it by an imprudent marriageand i know it was his belief whether justly or not of coursei cannot decide that your father and sister in their civilitiesand invitations were designing a match between the heirand the young lady and it was impossible that such a matchshould have answered his ideas of wealth and independencethat was his motive for drawing back i can assure youhe told me the whole story  he had no concealments with meit was curious that having just left you behind me in bathmy first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousinand that through him i should be continually hearing of your fatherand sister  he described one miss elliot and i thoughtvery affectionately of the otherperhaps cried anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimesspoke of me to mr elliotto be sure i did very often  i used to boast of my own anne elliotand vouch for your being a very different creature from--she checked herself just in timethis accounts for something which mr elliot said last nightcried anne  this explains it  i found he had been used to hear of mei could not comprehend how  what wild imaginations one forms wheredear self is concerned!  how sure to be mistaken!  but i beg your pardoni have interrupted you  mr elliot married then completely for moneythe circumstances probably which first opened your eyesto his charactermrs smith hesitated a little here  oh! those things are too commonwhen one lives in the world a man or woman's marrying for moneyis too common to strike one as it ought  i was very youngand associated only with the young and we were a thoughtlessgay set without any strict rules of conduct  we lived for enjoymenti think differently now time and sickness and sorrow have given meother notions but at that period i must own i saw nothing reprehensiblein what mr elliot was doing  `to do the best for himself'passed as a dutybut was not she a very low womanyes which i objected to but he would not regard  money moneywas all that he wanted  her father was a grazier her grandfatherhad been a butcher but that was all nothing  she was a fine womanhad had a decent education was brought forward by some cousinsthrown by chance into mr elliot's company and fell in love with himand not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his sidewith respect to her birth  all his caution was spent in being securedof the real amount of her fortune before he committed himselfdepend upon it whatever esteem mr elliot may have for his own situationin life now as a young man he had not the smallest value for ithis chance for the kellynch estate was something but all the honourof the family he held as cheap as dirt  i have often heard him declarethat if baronetcies were saleable anybody should have hisfor fifty pounds arms and motto name and livery includedbut i will not pretend to repeat half that i used to hear him sayon that subject  it would not be fair and yet you ought to have prooffor what is all this but assertion and you shall have proofindeed my dear mrs smith i want none cried anne  you have assertednothing contradictory to what mr elliot appeared to be some years agothis is all in confirmation rather of what we used to hear and believei am more curious to know why he should be so different nowbut for my satisfaction if you will have the goodness to ring for marystay  i am sure you will have the still greater goodness ofgoing yourself into my bedroom and bringing me the small inlaid boxwhich you will find on the upper shelf of the closetanne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desiredthe box was brought and placed before her and mrs smith sighing over itas she unlocked it said--this is full of papers belonging to him to my husbanda small portion only of what i had to look over when i lost himthe letter i am looking for was one written by mr elliot to himbefore our marriage and happened to be saved why one can hardly imaginebut he was careless and immethodical like other men about those thingsand when i came to examine his papers i found it with othersstill more trivial from different people scattered here and therewhile many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyedhere it is i would not burn it because being even then very littlesatisfied with mr elliot i was determined to preserve every documentof former intimacy  i have now another motive for being gladthat i can produce itthis was the letter directed to charles smith esq tunbridge wellsand dated from london as far back as july 1803 --dear smith--i have received yours  your kindness almost overpowers mei wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common but i havelived three-and-twenty years in the world and have seen none like itat present believe me i have no need of your servicesbeing in cash again  give me joy  i have got rid of sir walter and missthey are gone back to kellynch and almost made me swear to visit themthis summer but my first visit to kellynch will be with a surveyorto tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammerthe baronet nevertheless is not unlikely to marry againhe is quite fool enough  if he does however they will leave me in peacewhich may be a decent equivalent  for the reversion  he is worsethan last yeari wish i had any name but elliot  i am sick of it  the name of walteri can drop thank god! and i desire you will never insult mewith my second w again meaning for the rest of my lifeto be only yours truly--wm elliotsuch a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glowand mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said--the language i know is highly disrespectful  though i have forgotthe exact terms i have a perfect impression of the general meaningbut it shows you the man  mark his professions to my poor husbandcan any thing be strongeranne could not immediately get over the shock and mortificationof finding such words applied to her father  she was obliged to recollectthat her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honourthat no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimoniesthat no private correspondence could bear the eye of othersbefore she could recover calmness enough to return the letterwhich she had been meditating over and say--thank you  this is full proof undoubtedly proof of every thingyou were saying  but why be acquainted with us nowi can explain this too cried mrs smith smilingcan you reallyyes  i have shewn you mr elliot as he was a dozen years agoand i will shew him as he is now  i cannot produce written proof againbut i can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire of whathe is now wanting and what he is now doing  he is no hypocrite nowhe truly wants to marry you  his present attentions to your familyare very sincere  quite from the heart  i will give you my authorityhis friend colonel walliscolonel wallis! you are acquainted with himno  it does not come to me in quite so direct a line as thatit takes a bend or two but nothing of consequence  the streamis as good as at first the little rubbish it collects in the turningsis easily moved away  mr elliot talks unreservedly to colonel wallisof his views on you which said colonel wallis i imagine to bein himself a sensible careful discerning sort of characterbut colonel wallis has a very pretty silly wife to whomhe tells things which he had better not and he repeats it all to hershe in the overflowing spirits of her recovery repeats it allto her nurse and the nurse  knowing my acquaintance with youvery naturally brings it all to me  on monday evening my good friendmrs rooke let me thus much into the secrets of marlborough buildingswhen i talked of a whole history therefore you see i wasnot romancing so much as you supposedmy dear mrs smith your authority is deficient  this will not domr elliot's having any views on me will not in the least accountfor the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my fatherthat was all prior to my coming to bath  i found them onthe most friendly terms when i arrivedi know you did i know it all perfectly but--indeed mrs smith we must not expect to get real informationin such a line  facts or opinions which are to pass through the handsof so many to be misconceived by folly in one and ignorance in anothercan hardly have much truth leftonly give me a hearing  you will soon be able to judge ofthe general credit due by listening to some particularswhich you can yourself immediately contradict or confirmnobody supposes that you were his first inducement  he had seen youindeed before he came to bath and admired you but withoutknowing it to be you  so says my historian at least  is this truedid he see you last summer or autumn `somewhere down in the west'to use her own words without knowing it to be youhe certainly did  so far it is very true  at lymei happened to be at lymewell continued mrs smith triumphantly grant my friend the creditdue to the establishment of the first point asserted  he saw you thenat lyme and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleasedto meet with you again in camden place as miss anne elliotand from that moment i have no doubt had a double motivein his visits there  but there was another and an earlierwhich i will now explain  if there is anything in my story which you knowto be either false or improbable stop me  my account statesthat your sister's friend the lady now staying with youwhom i have heard you mention came to bath with miss elliot and sir walteras long ago as september in short when they first came themselvesand has been staying there ever since that she is a clever insinuatinghandsome woman poor and plausible and altogether such in situationand manner as to give a general idea among sir walter's acquaintanceof her meaning to be lady elliot and as general a surprisethat miss elliot should be apparently blind to the dangerhere mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to sayand she continued--this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the familylong before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eyeupon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not thenvisit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interestin watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bathfor a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmascolonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of thingsand the reports beginning to prevail  now you are to understandthat time had worked a very material change in mr elliot's opinionsas to the value of a baronetcy  upon all points of blood and connexionhe is a completely altered man  having long had as much moneyas he could spend nothing to wish for on the side of avariceor indulgence he has been gradually learning to pin his happinessupon the consequence he is heir to  i thought it coming onbefore our acquaintance ceased but it is now a confirmed feelinghe cannot bear the idea of not being sir william  you may guesstherefore that the news he heard from his friend could not bevery agreeable and you may guess what it produced the resolutionof coming back to bath as soon as possible and of fixing himself herefor a time with the view of renewing his former acquaintanceand recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the meansof ascertaining the degree of his danger and of circumventing the ladyif he found it material  this was agreed upon between the two friendsas the only thing to be done and colonel wallis was to assistin every way that he could  he was to be introduced and mrs walliswas to be introduced and everybody was to be introducedmr elliot came back accordingly and on application was forgivenas you know and re-admitted into the family and there it washis constant object and his only object till your arrivaladded another motive to watch sir walter and mrs clayhe omitted no opportunity of being with them threw himself in their waycalled at all hours but i need not be particular on this subjectyou can imagine what an artful man would do and with this guideperhaps may recollect what you have seen him doyes said anne you tell me nothing which does not accord withwhat i have known or could imagine  there is always something offensivein the details of cunning  the manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicitymust ever be revolting but i have heard nothing which really surprises mei know those who would be shocked by such a representation of mr elliotwho would have difficulty in believing it but i have never been satisfiedi have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appearedi should like to know his present opinion as to the probabilityof the event he has been in dread of whether he considers the dangerto be lessening or notlessening i understand replied mrs smith  he thinks mrs clayafraid of him aware that he sees through her and not daring to proceedas she might do in his absence  but since he must be absentsome time or other i do not perceive how he can ever be securewhile she holds her present influence  mrs wallis has an amusing ideaas nurse tells me that it is to be put into the marriage articleswhen you and mr elliot marry that your father is not to marry mrs claya scheme worthy of mrs wallis's understanding by all accountsbut my sensible nurse rooke sees the absurdity of it  `why to be surema'am' said she `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else'and indeed to own the truth i do not think nurse in her heartis a very strenuous opposer of sir walter's making a second matchshe must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony you knowand since self will intrude who can say that she may not havesome flying visions of attending the next lady elliot throughmrs wallis's recommendationi am very glad to know all this said anne after a littlethoughtfulness  it will be more painful to me in some respectsto be in company with him but i shall know better what to domy line of conduct will be more direct  mr elliot is evidentlya disingenuous artificial worldly man who has never hadany better principle to guide him than selfishnessbut mr elliot was not done with  mrs smith had been carried awayfrom her first direction and anne had forgotten in the interestof her own family concerns how much had been originally impliedagainst him but her attention was now called to the explanationof those first hints and she listened to a recital whichif it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of mrs smithproved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards hervery deficient both in justice and compassionshe learned that the intimacy between them continuing unimpairedby mr elliot's marriage they had been as before always togetherand mr elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortunemrs smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tenderof throwing any on her husband but anne could collect that their incomehad never been equal to their style of living and that from the firstthere had been a great deal of general and joint extravagancefrom his wife's account of him she could discern mr smith to have beena man of warm feelings easy temper careless habits and not strongunderstanding much more amiable than his friend and very unlike himled by him and probably despised by him  mr elliot raised byhis marriage to great affluence and disposed to every gratificationof pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himselffor with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent manand beginning to be rich just as his friend ought to have found himselfto be poor seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend'sprobable finances but on the contrary had been prompting andencouraging expenses which could end only in ruin and the smithsaccordingly had been ruinedthe husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of itthey had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendshipof their friends and to prove that mr elliot's had better not be triedbut it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairswas fully known  with a confidence in mr elliot's regardmore creditable to his feelings than his judgement mr smith hadappointed him the executor of his will but mr elliot would not actand the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on herin addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation had been suchas could not be related without anguish of spirit or listened towithout corresponding indignationanne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers tourgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the samestern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble andunder a cold civility the same hard-hearted indifferenceto any of the evils it might bring on her  it was a dreadful pictureof ingratitude and inhumanity and anne felt at some momentsthat no flagrant open crime could have been worse  she had a great dealto listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiaeof distress upon distress which in former conversations had beenmerely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgenceanne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was onlythe more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend'susual state of mindthere was one circumstance in the history of her grievancesof particular irritation  she had good reason to believe thatsome property of her husband in the west indies which had beenfor many years under a sort of sequestration for the paymentof its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measuresand this property though not large would be enough to makeher comparatively rich  but there was nobody to stir in itmr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herselfequally disabled from personal exertion by her state ofbodily weakness and from employing others by her want of moneyshe had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counseland she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the lawthis was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened meansto feel that she ought to be in better circumstancesthat a little trouble in the right place might do itand to fear that delay might be even weakening her claimswas hard to bearit was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne's good officeswith mr elliot  she had previously in the anticipationof their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by itbut on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that naturesince he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurredthat something might be done in her favour by the influence of the womanhe loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne's feelingsas far as the observances due to mr elliot's character would allowwhen anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changedthe face of everything and while it took from her the new-formed hopeof succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at leastthe comfort of telling the whole story her own wayafter listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not butexpress some surprise at mrs smith's having spoken of him so favourablyin the beginning of their conversation  she had seemed to recommendand praise him!my dear was mrs smith's reply there was nothing else to be donei considered your marrying him as certain though he might not yethave made the offer and i could no more speak the truth of himthan if he had been your husband  my heart bled for youas i talked of happiness and yet he is sensible he is agreeableand with such a woman as you it was not absolutely hopelesshe was very unkind to his first wife  they were wretched togetherbut she was too ignorant and giddy for respect and he had never loved heri was willing to hope that you must fare betteranne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibilityof having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the ideaof the misery which must have followed  it was just possible thatshe might have been persuaded by lady russell!  and under sucha supposition which would have been most miserable when time haddisclosed all too lateit was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceivedand one of the concluding arrangements of this important conferencewhich carried them through the greater part of the morningwas that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friendeverything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involvedchapter 22anne went home to think over all that she had heard  in one pointher feelings were relieved by this knowledge of mr elliotthere was no longer anything of tenderness due to him  he stood asopposed to captain wentworth in all his own unwelcome obtrusivenessand the evil of his attentions last night the irremediable mischiefhe might have done was considered with sensations unqualified unperplexedpity for him was all over  but this was the only point of reliefin every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forwardshe saw more to distrust and to apprehend  she was concernedfor the disappointment and pain lady russell would be feelingfor the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sisterand had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowinghow to avert any one of them  she was most thankful for her ownknowledge of him  she had never considered herself as entitled to rewardfor not slighting an old friend like mrs smith but here wasa reward indeed springing from it!  mrs smith had been able to tell herwhat no one else could have done  could the knowledge havebeen extended through her family  but this was a vain ideashe must talk to lady russell tell her consult with herand having done her best wait the event with as much composureas possible and after all her greatest want of composure would bein that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to lady russellin that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herselfshe found on reaching home that she had as she intendedescaped seeing mr elliot that he had called and paid thema long morning visit but hardly had she congratulated herselfand felt safe when she heard that he was coming again in the eveningi had not the smallest intention of asking him said elizabethwith affected carelessness but he gave so many hintsso mrs clay says at leastindeed i do say it  i never saw anybody in my life spell harderfor an invitation  poor man!  i was really in pain for himfor your hard-hearted sister miss anne seems bent on crueltyoh! cried elizabeth i have been rather too much used to the gameto be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints  however when i foundhow excessively he was regretting that he should miss my fatherthis morning i gave way immediately for i would never really omitan opportunity of bring him and sir walter together  they appear toso much advantage in company with each other  each behaving so pleasantlymr elliot looking up with so much respectquite delightful! cried mrs clay not daring howeverto turn her eyes towards anne  exactly like father and son!dear miss elliot may i not say father and sonoh! i lay no embargo on any body's words  if you will have suchideas!  but upon my word i am scarcely sensible of his attentionsbeing beyond those of other menmy dear miss elliot! exclaimed mrs clay lifting her hands and eyesand sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silencewell my dear penelope you need not be so alarmed about himi did invite him you know  i sent him away with smileswhen i found he was really going to his friends at thornberry parkfor the whole day to-morrow i had compassion on himanne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shewsuch pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrivalof the very person whose presence must really be interfering withher prime object  it was impossible but that mrs clay must hatethe sight of mr elliot and yet she could assume a most obligingplacid look and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed licenseof devoting herself only half as much to sir walter as she would havedone otherwiseto anne herself it was most distressing to see mr elliot enter the roomand quite painful to have him approach and speak to hershe had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincerebut now she saw insincerity in everything  his attentive deferenceto her father contrasted with his former language was odiousand when she thought of his cruel conduct towards mrs smithshe could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildnessor the sound of his artificial good sentimentsshe meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provokea remonstrance on his side  it was a great object to her to escapeall enquiry or eclat but it was her intention to be as decidedly coolto him as might be compatible with their relationship and to retraceas quietly as she could the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she hadbeen gradually led along  she was accordingly more guardedand more cool than she had been the night beforehe wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and wherehe could have heard her formerly praised wanted very muchto be gratified by more solicitation but the charm was brokenhe found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessaryto kindle his modest cousin's vanity he found at least that it wasnot to be done now by any of those attempts which he could hazardamong the too-commanding claims of the others  he little surmisedthat it was a subject acting now exactly against his interestbringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conductwhich were least excusableshe had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of baththe next morning going early and that he would be gone the greater partof two days  he was invited again to camden place the very evening ofhis return but from thursday to saturday evening his absence was certainit was bad enough that a mrs clay should be always before herbut that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their partyseemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfortit was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practisedon her father and elizabeth to consider the various sourcesof mortification preparing for them!  mrs clay's selfishness wasnot so complicate nor so revolting as his and anne would have compoundedfor the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of mr elliot'ssubtleties in endeavouring to prevent iton friday morning she meant to go very early to lady russelland accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gonedirectly after breakfast but that mrs clay was also going outon some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble whichdetermined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companionshe saw mrs clay fairly off therefore before she began to talkof spending the morning in rivers streetvery well said elizabeth i have nothing to send but my loveoh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend meand pretend i have read it through  i really cannot be plaguing myselffor ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come outlady russell quite bores one with her new publicationsyou need not tell her so but i thought her dress hideous the other nighti used to think she had some taste in dress but i was ashamed of herat the concert  something so formal and arrange in her air!and she sits so upright!  my best love of courseand mine added sir walter  kindest regards  and you may saythat i mean to call upon her soon  make a civil messagebut i shall only leave my card  morning visits are never fairby women at her time of life who make themselves up so littleif she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seenbut last time i called i observed the blinds were let down immediatelywhile her father spoke there was a knock at the door  who could it beanne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of mr elliotwould have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles offafter the usual period of suspense the usual sounds of approach were heardand mr and mrs charles musgrove were ushered into the roomsurprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearancebut anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorrybut that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soonas it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrivedwith an views of accommodation in that house sir walter and elizabethwere able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very wellthey were come to bath for a few days with mrs musgrove and wereat the white hart  so much was pretty soon understoodbut till sir walter and elizabeth were walking mary intothe other drawing-room and regaling themselves with her admirationanne could not draw upon charles's brain for a regular historyof their coming or an explanation of some smiling hintsof particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by maryas well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted ofshe then found that it consisted of mrs musgrove henriettaand captain harville beside their two selves  he gave her a very plainintelligible account of the whole a narration in which she sawa great deal of most characteristic proceeding  the schemehad received its first impulse by captain harville's wanting tocome to bath on business  he had begun to talk of it a week agoand by way of doing something as shooting was over charles had proposedcoming with him and mrs harville had seemed to like the idea of itvery much as an advantage to her husband but mary could not bearto be left and had made herself so unhappy about it that for a day or twoeverything seemed to be in suspense or at an end  but thenit had been taken up by his father and mother  his mother hadsome old friends in bath whom she wanted to see it was thoughta good opportunity for henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothesfor herself and her sister and in short it ended in beinghis mother's party that everything might be comfortable and easyto captain harville and he and mary were included in itby way of general convenience  they had arrived late the night beforemrs harville her children and captain benwick remained withmr musgrove and louisa at uppercrossanne's only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enoughfor henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of  she had imaginedsuch difficulties of fortune to exist there as must preventthe marriage from being near at hand but she learned from charles thatvery recently since mary's last letter to herself charles hayterhad been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youthwho could not possibly claim it under many years and thaton the strength of his present income with almost a certaintyof something more permanent long before the term in questionthe two families had consented to the young people's wishesand that their marriage was likely to take place in a few monthsquite as soon as louisa's  and a very good living it wascharles added  only five-and-twenty miles from uppercrossand in a very fine country   fine part of dorsetshirein the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdomsurrounded by three great proprietors each more careful and jealousthan the other and to two of the three at least charles hayter might geta special recommendation  not that he will value it as he oughthe observed charles is too cool about sporting that's the worst of himi am extremely glad indeed cried anne particularly gladthat this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserveequally well and who have always been such good friendsthe pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comforti hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to bothoh! yes  my father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were richerbut he has no other fault to find  money you know coming down withmoney--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operationand it streightens him as to many things  however i do not mean to saythey have not a right to it  it is very fit they should havedaughters' shares and i am sure he has always been a very kindliberal father to me  mary does not above half like henrietta's matchshe never did you know  but she does not do him justicenor think enough about winthrop  i cannot make her attend tothe value of the property  it is a very fair match as times goand i have liked charles hayter all my life and i shall not leave off nowsuch excellent parents as mr and mrs musgrove exclaimed anneshould be happy in their children's marriages  they do everythingto confer happiness i am sure  what a blessing to young peopleto be in such hands!  your father and mother seem so totally freefrom all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconductand misery both in young and old  i hope you think louisaperfectly recovered nowhe answered rather hesitatingly yes i believe i do very much recoveredbut she is altered there is no running or jumping about no laughingor dancing it is quite different  if one happens only to shut the doora little hard she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the waterand benwick sits at her elbow reading verses or whispering to herall day longanne could not help laughing  that cannot be much to your tastei know said she but i do believe him to be an excellent young manto be sure he is  nobody doubts it and i hope you do not thinki am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects andpleasures as myself  i have a great value for benwick and when one canbut get him to talk he has plenty to say  his reading has done himno harm for he has fought as well as read  he is a brave fellowi got more acquainted with him last monday than ever i did beforewe had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning inmy father's great barns and he played his part so wellthat i have liked him the better ever sincehere they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of charles'sfollowing the others to admire mirrors and china but anne hadheard enough to understand the present state of uppercrossand rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoicedher sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it  she would certainlyhave risen to their blessings if she could but she did not wantto lessen theirsthe visit passed off altogether in high good humour  mary wasin excellent spirits enjoying the gaiety and the changeand so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriagewith four horses and with her own complete independence of camden placethat she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she oughtand enter most readily into all the superiorities of the houseas they were detailed to her  she had no demands on her father or sisterand her consequence was just enough increased by their handsomedrawing-roomselizabeth was for a short time suffering a good dealshe felt that mrs musgrove and all her party ought to be askedto dine with them but she could not bear to have the difference of stylethe reduction of servants which a dinner must betray witnessed by thosewho had been always so inferior to the elliots of kellynchit was a struggle between propriety and vanity but vanity got the betterand then elizabeth was happy again  these were her internal persuasionsold fashioned notions country hospitality we do not professto give dinners few people in bath do lady alicia never doesdid not even ask her own sister's family though they were here a monthand i dare say it would be very inconvenient to mrs musgroveput her quite out of her way  i am sure she would rather not comeshe cannot feel easy with us  i will ask them all for an eveningthat will be much better that will be a novelty and a treatthey have not seen two such drawing rooms before  they will be delightedto come to-morrow evening  it shall be a regular party smallbut most elegant  and this satisfied elizabeth  and when the invitationwas given to the two present and promised for the absentmary was as completely satisfied  she was particularly askedto meet mr elliot and be introduced to lady dalrymple and miss carteretwho were fortunately already engaged to come and she could nothave received a more gratifying attention  miss elliot was to havethe honour of calling on mrs musgrove in the course of the morningand anne walked off with charles and mary to go and see herand henrietta directlyher plan of sitting with lady russell must give way for the presentthey all three called in rivers street for a couple of minutesbut anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communicationcould be of no consequence and hastened forward to the white hartto see again the friends and companions of the last autumnwith an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to formthey found mrs musgrove and her daughter within and by themselvesand anne had the kindest welcome from each  henrietta was exactlyin that state of recently-improved views of fresh-formed happinesswhich made her full of regard and interest for everybody she hadever liked before at all and mrs musgrove's real affection had been wonby her usefulness when they were in distress  it was a heartinessand a warmth and a sincerity which anne delighted in the morefrom the sad want of such blessings at home  she was entreatedto give them as much of her time as possible invited for every dayand all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in returnshe naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistanceand on charles's leaving them together was listening to mrs musgrove'shistory of louisa and to henrietta's of herself giving opinionson business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every helpwhich mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accountsfrom finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to tryingto convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody which marywell amused as she generally was in her station at a windowoverlooking the entrance to the pump room could not but haveher moments of imagininga morning of thorough confusion was to be expected  a large partyin an hotel ensured a quick-changing unsettled scene  one five minutesbrought a note the next a parcel and anne had not been therehalf an hour when their dining-room spacious as it wasseemed more than half filled  a party of steady old friendswere seated around mrs musgrove and charles came back withcaptains harville and wentworth  the appearance of the lattercould not be more than the surprise of the moment  it was impossiblefor her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of theircommon friends must be soon bringing them together againtheir last meeting had been most important in opening his feelingsshe had derived from it a delightful conviction but she fearedfrom his looks that the same unfortunate persuasion which hadhastened him away from the concert room still governedhe did not seem to want to be near enough for conversationshe tried to be calm and leave things to take their courseand tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence--surely if there be constant attachment on each side our heartsmust understand each other ere long  we are not boy and girlto be captiously irritable misled by every moment's inadvertenceand wantonly playing with our own happiness  and yeta few minutes afterwards she felt as if their being in companywith each other under their present circumstances could only beexposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the mostmischievous kindanne cried mary still at her window there is mrs clayi am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with heri saw them turn the corner from bath street just now  they seemeddeep in talk  who is it  come and tell me  good heavens! i recollectit is mr elliot himselfno cried anne quickly it cannot be mr elliot i assure youhe was to leave bath at nine this morning and does not come backtill to-morrowas she spoke she felt that captain wentworth was looking at herthe consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regretthat she had said so much simple as it wasmary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousinbegan talking very warmly about the family features and protestingstill more positively that it was mr elliot calling again upon anneto come and look for herself but anne did not mean to stirand tried to be cool and unconcerned  her distress returnedhowever on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass betweentwo or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselvesquite in the secret  it was evident that the report concerning herhad spread and a short pause succeeded which seemed to ensurethat it would now spread fartherdo come anne cried mary come and look yourself  you will be too lateif you do not make haste  they are parting they are shaking handshe is turning away  not know mr elliot indeed!  you seem to haveforgot all about lymeto pacify mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassmentanne did move quietly to the window  she was just in time to ascertainthat it really was mr elliot which she had never believedbefore he disappeared on one side as mrs clay walked quickly offon the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feelat such an appearance of friendly conference between two personsof totally opposite interest she calmly said yes it is mr elliotcertainly  he has changed his hour of going i suppose that is allor i may be mistaken i might not attend and walked back to her chairrecomposed and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself wellthe visitors took their leave and charles having civilly seen them offand then made a face at them and abused them for coming began with--well mother i have done something for you that you will likei have been to the theatre and secured a box for to-morrow nighta'n't i a good boy  i know you love a play and there is room for us allit holds nine  i have engaged captain wentworth  anne willnot be sorry to join us i am sure  we all like a playhave not i done well mothermrs musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readinessfor the play if henrietta and all the others liked it when maryeagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--good heavens charles! how can you think of such a thingtake a box for to-morrow night!  have you forgot that we are engagedto camden place to-morrow night and that we were most particularly askedto meet lady dalrymple and her daughter and mr elliot and allthe principal family connexions on purpose to be introduced to themhow can you be so forgetfulphoo! phoo! replied charles what's an evening partynever worth remembering  your father might have asked us to dinneri think if he had wanted to see us  you may do as you likebut i shall go to the playoh! charles i declare it will be too abominable if you dowhen you promised to gono i did not promise  i only smirked and bowed and said the word`happy'  there was no promisebut you must go charles  it would be unpardonable to failwe were asked on purpose to be introduced  there was alwayssuch a great connexion between the dalrymples and ourselvesnothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediatelywe are quite near relations you know and mr elliot toowhom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!  every attentionis due to mr elliot  consider my father's heir  the futurerepresentative of the familydon't talk to me about heirs and representatives cried charlesi am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bowto the rising sun  if i would not go for the sake of your fatheri should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heirwhat is mr elliot to me  the careless expression was life to annewho saw that captain wentworth was all attention looking andlistening with his whole soul and that the last words broughthis enquiring eyes from charles to herselfcharles and mary still talked on in the same style he half seriousand half jesting maintaining the scheme for the play and sheinvariably serious most warmly opposing it and not omittingto make it known that however determined to go to camden place herselfshe should not think herself very well used if they went to the playwithout her  mrs musgrove interposedwe had better put it off  charles you had much better go backand change the box for tuesday  it would be a pity to be dividedand we should be losing miss anne too if there is a party at her father'sand i am sure neither henrietta nor i should care at all for the playif miss anne could not be with usanne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as muchso for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--if it depended only on my inclination ma'am the party at homeexcepting on mary's account would not be the smallest impedimenti have no pleasure in the sort of meeting and should be too happyto change it for a play and with you  but it had betternot be attempted perhaps  she had spoken it but she trembledwhen it was done conscious that her words were listened toand daring not even to try to observe their effectit was soon generally agreed that tuesday should be the daycharles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wifeby persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else wouldcaptain wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire-placeprobably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwardsand taking a station with less bare-faced design by anneyou have not been long enough in bath said he to enjoythe evening parties of the placeoh! no  the usual character of them has nothing for mei am no card-playeryou were not formerly i know  you did not use to like cardsbut time makes many changesi am not yet so much changed cried anne and stopped fearing shehardly knew what misconstruction  after waiting a few momentshe said and as if it were the result of immediate feelingit is a period indeed!  eight years and a half is a periodwhether he would have proceeded farther was left to anne's imaginationto ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the soundshe had uttered she was startled to other subjects by henriettaeager to make use of the present leisure for getting outand calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody elseshould come inthey were obliged to move  anne talked of being perfectly readyand tried to look it but she felt that could henrietta have knownthe regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chairin preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her ownsensations for her cousin in the very security of his affectionwherewith to pity hertheir preparations however were stopped short  alarming soundswere heard other visitors approached and the door was thrown openfor sir walter and miss elliot whose entrance seemed to givea general chill  anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she lookedsaw symptoms of the same  the comfort the freedom the gaietyof the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silenceor insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sisterhow mortifying to feel that it was so!her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular  captain wentworthwas acknowledged again by each by elizabeth more graciously than beforeshe even addressed him once and looked at him more than onceelizabeth was in fact revolving a great measure  the sequelexplained it  after the waste of a few minutes in sayingthe proper nothings she began to give the invitation whichwas to comprise all the remaining dues of the musgrovesto-morrow evening to meet a few friends  no formal partyit was all said very gracefully and the cards with which she hadprovided herself the miss elliot at home were laid on the tablewith a courteous comprehensive smile to all and one smile andone card more decidedly for captain wentworth  the truth wasthat elizabeth had been long enough in bath to understandthe importance of a man of such an air and appearance as histhe past was nothing  the present was that captain wentworthwould move about well in her drawing-room  the card was pointedly givenand sir walter and elizabeth arose and disappearedthe interruption had been short though severe and ease and animationreturned to most of those they left as the door shut them outbut not to anne  she could think only of the invitation she hadwith such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in whichit had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise ratherthan gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptanceshe knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believethat he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonementfor all the insolence of the past  her spirits sank  he held the cardin his hand after they were gone as if deeply considering itonly think of elizabeth's including everybody! whispered maryvery audibly  i do not wonder captain wentworth is delighted!you see he cannot put the card out of his handanne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itselfinto a momentary expression of contempt and turned awaythat she might neither see nor hear more to vex herthe party separated  the gentlemen had their own pursuitsthe ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more whileanne belonged to them  she was earnestly begged to return and dineand give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had beenso long exerted that at present she felt unequal to moreand fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silentas she chosepromising to be with them the whole of the following morning thereforeshe closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to camden placethere to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangementsof elizabeth and mrs clay for the morrow's party the frequent enumerationof the persons invited and the continually improving detail of allthe embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegantof its kind in bath while harassing herself with the never-endingquestion of whether captain wentworth would come or not  they werereckoning him as certain but with her it was a gnawing solicitudenever appeased for five minutes together  she generally thoughthe would come because she generally thought he ought but it was a casewhich she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretionas inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelingsshe only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitationto let mrs clay know that she had been seen with mr elliotthree hours after his being supposed to be out of bathfor having watched in vain for some intimation of the interviewfrom the lady herself she determined to mention it and it seemed to herthere was guilt in mrs clay's face as she listened  it was transientcleared away in an instant but anne could imagine she read therethe consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trickor some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attendperhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designson sir walter  she exclaimed however with a very tolerableimitation of nature --oh! dear! very true  only think miss elliot to my great surprisei met with mr elliot in bath street  i was never more astonishedhe turned back and walked with me to the pump yard  he had been preventedsetting off for thornberry but i really forget by whatfor i was in a hurry and could not much attend and i can only answerfor his being determined not to be delayed in his returnhe wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrowhe was full of `to-morrow' and it is very evident that i have beenfull of it too ever since i entered the house and learnt the extensionof your plan and all that had happened or my seeing him could never havegone so entirely out of my headchapter 23one day only had passed since anne's conversation with mrs smithbut a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touchedby mr elliot's conduct except by its effects in one quarterthat it became a matter of course the next morning still to deferher explanatory visit in rivers street  she had promised to bewith the musgroves from breakfast to dinner  her faith was plightedand mr elliot's character like the sultaness scheherazade's headmust live another dayshe could not keep her appointment punctually howeverthe weather was unfavourable and she had grieved over the rainon her friends' account and felt it very much on her ownbefore she was able to attempt the walk  when she reached the white hartand made her way to the proper apartment she found herselfneither arriving quite in time nor the first to arrivethe party before her were mrs musgrove talking to mrs croftand captain harville to captain wentworth and she immediately heardthat mary and henrietta too impatient to wait had gone out the momentit had cleared but would be back again soon and that the strictestinjunctions had been left with mrs musgrove to keep her theretill they returned  she had only to submit sit downbe outwardly composed and feel herself plunged at oncein all the agitations which she had merely laid her account oftasting a little before the morning closed  there was no delayno waste of time  she was deep in the happiness of such miseryor the misery of such happiness instantly  two minutes afterher entering the room captain wentworth said--we will write the letter we were talking of harville nowif you will give me materialsmaterials were at hand on a separate table he went to itand nearly turning his back to them all was engrossed by writingmrs musgrove was giving mrs croft the history of her eldestdaughter's engagement and just in that inconvenient tone of voicewhich was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisperanne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yetas captain harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talkshe could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such ashow mr musgrove and my brother hayter had met again and againto talk it over what my brother hayter had said one dayand what mr musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurredto my sister hayter and what the young people had wished and whati said at first i never could consent to but was afterwards persuadedto think might do very well and a great deal in the same styleof open-hearted communication  minutiae which even with every advantageof taste and delicacy which good mrs musgrove could not givecould be properly interesting only to the principals  mrs croftwas attending with great good-humour and whenever she spoke at allit was very sensibly  anne hoped the gentlemen might each betoo much self-occupied to hearand so ma'am all these thing considered said mrs musgrovein her powerful whisper though we could have wished it differentyet altogether we did not think it fair to stand out any longerfor charles hayter was quite wild about it and henrietta waspretty near as bad and so we thought they had better marry at onceand make the best of it as many others have done before themat any rate said i it will be better than a long engagementthat is precisely what i was going to observe cried mrs crofti would rather have young people settle on a small income at onceand have to struggle with a few difficulties together than beinvolved in a long engagement  i always think that no mutual--oh! dear mrs croft cried mrs musgrove unable to let herfinish her speech there is nothing i so abominate for young peopleas a long engagement  it is what i always protested againstfor my children  it is all very well i used to say for young peopleto be engaged if there is a certainty of their being able to marryin six months or even in twelve but a long engagement--yes dear ma'am said mrs croft or an uncertain engagementan engagement which may be long  to begin without knowingthat at such a time there will be the means of marryingi hold to be very unsafe and unwise and what i think all parentsshould prevent as far as they cananne found an unexpected interest here  she felt its applicationto herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the samemoment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant tablecaptain wentworth's pen ceased to move his head was raised pausinglistening and he turned round the next instant to give a lookone quick conscious look at herthe two ladies continued to talk to re-urge the same admitted truthsand enforce them with such examples of the ill effect ofa contrary practice as had fallen within their observationbut anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her earher mind was in confusioncaptain harville who had in truth been hearing none of itnow left his seat and moved to a window and anne seeming to watch himthough it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensiblethat he was inviting her to join him where he stood  he looked at herwith a smile and a little motion of the head which expressedcome to me i have something to say and the unaffectedeasy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintancethan he really was strongly enforced the invitation  she roused herselfand went to him  the window at which he stood was at the other endof the room from where the two ladies were sitting and though nearerto captain wentworth's table not very near  as she joined himcaptain harville's countenance re-assumed the serious thoughtfulexpression which seemed its natural characterlook here said he unfolding a parcel in his hand and displayinga small miniature painting do you know who that iscertainly  captain benwickyes and you may guess who it is for  but in a deep toneit was not done for her  miss elliot do you remember ourwalking together at lyme and grieving for him  i little thought then--but no matter  this was drawn at the cape  he met witha clever young german artist at the cape and in compliance with a promiseto my poor sister sat to him and was bringing it home for herand i have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!it was a commission to me!  but who else was there to employi hope i can allow for him  i am not sorry indeed to make itover to another  he undertakes it looking towards captain wentworthhe is writing about it now  and with a quivering lip he wound upthe whole by adding poor fanny! she would not have forgotten him so soon!no replied anne in a low feeling voice that i can easily believeit was not in her nature  she doted on himit would not be the nature of any woman who truly lovedcaptain harville smiled as much as to say do you claim thatfor your sex and she answered the question smiling alsoyes  we certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget usit is perhaps our fate rather than our merit  we cannot help ourselveswe live at home quiet confined and our feelings prey upon usyou are forced on exertion  you have always a profession pursuitsbusiness of some sort or other to take you back into the world immediatelyand continual occupation and change soon weaken impressionsgranting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for menwhich however i do not think i shall grant it does not applyto benwick  he has not been forced upon any exertion  the peaceturned him on shore at the very moment and he has been living with usin our little family circle ever sincetrue said anne very true i did not recollect but what shallwe say now captain harville  if the change be not fromoutward circumstances it must be from within it must be natureman's nature which has done the business for captain benwickno no it is not man's nature  i will not allow it to be moreman's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do loveor have loved  i believe the reverse  i believe in a true analogybetween our bodily frames and our mental and that as our bodies arethe strongest so are our feelings capable of bearing most rough usageand riding out the heaviest weatheryour feelings may be the strongest replied anne but the same spiritof analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tenderman is more robust than woman but he is not longer livedwhich exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachmentsnay it would be too hard upon you if it were otherwiseyou have difficulties and privations and dangers enough to struggle withyou are always labouring and toiling exposed to every risk and hardshipyour home country friends all quitted  neither time nor healthnor life to be called your own  it would be hard indeedwith a faltering voice if woman's feelings were to beadded to all thiswe shall never agree upon this question captain harvillewas beginning to say when a slight noise called their attentionto captain wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the roomit was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but anne wasstartled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclinedto suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had beenoccupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not thinkhe could have caughthave you finished your letter said captain harvillenot quite a few lines more  i shall have done in five minutesthere is no hurry on my side  i am only ready whenever you arei am in very good anchorage here smiling at anne well suppliedand want for nothing  no hurry for a signal at all  well miss elliotlowering his voice as i was saying we shall never agreei suppose upon this point  no man and woman would probablybut let me observe that all histories are against you--all storiesprose and verse  if i had such a memory as benwick i could bring youfifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument and i do not thinki ever opened a book in my life which had not something to sayupon woman's inconstancy  songs and proverbs all talkof woman's fickleness  but perhaps you will say these were allwritten by menperhaps i shall  yes yes if you please no reference to examplesin books  men have had every advantage of us in telling their own storyeducation has been theirs in so much higher a degree the pen hasbeen in their hands  i will not allow books to prove anythingbut how shall we prove anythingwe never shall  we never can expect to prove any thing upon such a pointit is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proofwe each begin probably with a little bias towards our own sexand upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of itwhich has occurred within our own circle many of which circumstancesperhaps those very cases which strike us the most may be precisely suchas cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidenceor in some respect saying what should not be saidah! cried captain harville in a tone of strong feelingif i could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takesa last look at his wife and children and watches the boatthat he has sent them off in as long as it is in sightand then turns away and says `god knows whether we ever meet again!'and then if i could convey to you the glow of his soul when he doessee them again when coming back after a twelvemonth's absenceperhaps and obliged to put into another port he calculates how soonit be possible to get them there pretending to deceive himselfand saying `they cannot be here till such a day' but all the whilehoping for them twelve hours sooner and seeing them arrive at lastas if heaven had given them wings by many hours sooner still!if i could explain to you all this and all that a man can bear and doand glories to do for the sake of these treasures of his existence!i speak you know only of such men as have hearts! pressing his ownwith emotionoh! cried anne eagerly i hope i do justice to all that is felt by youand by those who resemble you  god forbid that i should undervaluethe warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!i should deserve utter contempt if i dared to suppose that true attachmentand constancy were known only by woman  no i believe you capableof everything great and good in your married lives  i believe you equalto every important exertion and to every domestic forbearanceso long as--if i may be allowed the expression--so long as you havean object  i mean while the woman you love lives and lives for youall the privilege i claim for my own sex it is not a very enviable oneyou need not covet it is that of loving longest when existenceor when hope is goneshe could not immediately have uttered another sentence her heartwas too full her breath too much oppressedyou are a good soul cried captain harville putting his handon her arm quite affectionately  there is no quarrelling with youand when i think of benwick my tongue is tiedtheir attention was called towards the others  mrs croft was taking leavehere frederick you and i part company i believe said shei am going home and you have an engagement with your friendto-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your partyturning to anne  we had your sister's card yesterdayand i understood frederick had a card too though i did not see itand you are disengaged frederick are you not as well as ourselvescaptain wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste and eithercould not or would not answer fullyyes said he very true here we separate but harville and ishall soon be after you that is harville if you are readyi am in half a minute  i know you will not be sorry to be offi shall be at your service in half a minutemrs croft left them and captain wentworth having sealed his letterwith great rapidity was indeed ready and had even a hurriedagitated air which shewed impatience to be gone  anne knew not howto understand it  she had the kindest good morning god bless you!from captain harville but from him not a word nor a look!he had passed out of the room without a look!she had only time however to move closer to the table wherehe had been writing when footsteps were heard returningthe door opened it was himself  he begged their pardonbut he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the roomto the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paperplaced it before anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on herfor a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the roomalmost before mrs musgrove was aware of his being in itthe work of an instant!the revolution which one instant had made in anne was almostbeyond expression  the letter with a direction hardly legibleto miss a e-- was evidently the one which he had been foldingso hastily  while supposed to be writing only to captain benwickhe had been also addressing her!  on the contents of that letterdepended all which this world could do for her  anything was possibleanything might be defied rather than suspense  mrs musgrove hadlittle arrangements of her own at her own table to their protectionshe must trust and sinking into the chair which he had occupiedsucceeding to the very spot where he had leaned and writtenher eyes devoured the following wordsi can listen no longer in silence  i must speak to you by such meansas are within my reach  you pierce my soul  i am half agonyhalf hope  tell me not that i am too late that such precious feelingsare gone for ever  i offer myself to you again with a hearteven more your own than when you almost broke it eight yearsand a half ago  dare not say that man forgets sooner than  womanthat his love has an earlier death  i have loved none but youunjust i may have been weak and resentful i have beenbut never inconstant  you alone have brought me to bathfor you alone i think and plan  have you not seen thiscan you fail to have understood my wishes  i had not waited eventhese ten days could i have read your feelings as i think you must havepenetrated mine  i can hardly write  i am every instant hearingsomething which overpowers me  you sink your voice but i candistinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on otherstoo good too excellent creature!  you do us justice indeedyou do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among menbelieve it to be most fervent most undeviating in f wi must go uncertain of my fate but i shall return hitheror follow your party as soon as possible  a word a lookwill be enough to decide whether i enter your father's housethis evening or neversuch a letter was not to be soon recovered from  half and hour's solitudeand reflection might have tranquillized her but the ten minutes onlywhich now passed before she was interrupted with all the restraintsof her situation could do nothing towards tranquillity  every momentrather brought fresh agitation  it was overpowering happinessand before she was beyond the first stage of full sensationcharles mary and henrietta all came inthe absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced thenan immediate struggle but after a while she could do no moreshe began not to understand a word they said and was obligedto plead indisposition and excuse herself  they could then seethat she looked very ill were shocked and concerned and would notstir without her for the world  this was dreadful  would they onlyhave gone away and left her in the quiet possession of that roomit would have been her cure but to have them all standing orwaiting around her was distracting and in desperationshe said she would go homeby all means my dear cried mrs musgrove go home directlyand take care of yourself that you may be fit for the eveningi wish sarah was here to doctor you but i am no doctor myselfcharles ring and order a chair  she must not walkbut the chair would never do  worse than all!  to lose the possibilityof speaking two words to captain wentworth in the course of her quietsolitary progress up the town and she felt almost certain of meeting himcould not be borne  the chair was earnestly protested againstand mrs musgrove who thought only of one sort of illnesshaving assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fallin the case that anne had not at any time lately slipped downand got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of havinghad no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend onfinding her better at nightanxious to omit no possible precaution anne struggled and said--i am afraid ma'am that it is not perfectly understoodpray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hopeto see your whole party this evening  i am afraid there had beensome mistake and i wish you particularly to assure captain harvilleand captain wentworth that we hope to see them bothoh! my dear it is quite understood i give you my wordcaptain harville has no thought but of goingdo you think so  but i am afraid and i should be so very sorrywill you promise me to mention it when you see them againyou will see them both this morning i dare say  do promise meto be sure i will if you wish it  charles if you see captain harvilleanywhere remember to give miss anne's message  but indeed my dearyou need not be uneasy  captain harville holds himself quite engagedi'll answer for it and captain wentworth the same i dare sayanne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischanceto damp the perfection of her felicity  it could not be very lastinghowever  even if he did not come to camden place himselfit would be in her power to send an intelligible sentenceby captain harville  another momentary vexation occurredcharles in his real concern and good nature would go home with herthere was no preventing him  this was almost cruel  but she could notbe long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith'sto be of use to her and she set off with him with no feelingbut gratitude apparentthey were on union street when a quicker step behind a somethingof familiar sound gave her two moments' preparation for the sightof captain wentworth  he joined them but as if irresolutewhether to join or to pass on said nothing only lookedanne could command herself enough to receive that lookand not repulsively  the cheeks which had been pale now glowedand the movements which had hesitated were decided  he walked by her sidepresently struck by a sudden thought charles said--captain wentworth which way are you going  only to gay streetor farther up the towni hardly know replied captain wentworth surprisedare you going as high as belmont  are you going near camden placebecause if you are i shall have no scruple in asking youto take my place and give anne your arm to her father's doorshe is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without helpand i ought to be at that fellow's in the market placehe promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send offsaid he would keep it unpacked to the last possible momentthat i might see it and if i do not turn back now i have no chanceby his description a good deal like the second size double-barrel of minewhich you shot with one day round winthropthere could not be an objection  there could be only the mostproper alacrity a most obliging compliance for public viewand smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapturein half a minute charles was at the bottom of union street againand the other two proceeding together  and soon words enough had passedbetween them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quietand retired gravel walk where the power of conversation would makethe present hour a blessing indeed and prepare it for allthe immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future livescould bestow  there they exchanged again those feelingsand those promises which had once before seemed to secure everythingbut which had been followed by so many many years of divisionand estrangement  there they returned again into the pastmore exquisitely happy perhaps in their re-union than whenit had been first projected more tender more tried more fixedin a knowledge of each other's character truth and attachmentmore equal to act more justified in acting  and there as they slowlypaced the gradual ascent heedless of every group around themseeing neither sauntering politicians bustling housekeepersflirting girls nor nursery-maids and children they could indulge inthose retrospections and acknowledgements and especially inthose explanations of what had directly preceded the present momentwhich were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest  all the littlevariations of the last week were gone through and of yesterdayand today there could scarcely be an endshe had not mistaken him  jealousy of mr elliot had beenthe retarding weight the doubt the torment  that had begun to operatein the very hour of first meeting her in bath that had returnedafter a short suspension to ruin the concert and that had influenced himin everything he had said and done or omitted to say and doin the last four-and-twenty hours  it had been gradually yieldingto the better hopes which her looks or words or actionsoccasionally encouraged it had been vanquished at last bythose sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talkedwith captain harville and under the irresistible governance of whichhe had seized a sheet of paper and poured out his feelingsof what he had then written nothing was to be retracted or qualifiedhe persisted in having loved none but her  she had never been supplantedhe never even believed himself to see her equal  thus much indeedhe was obliged to acknowledge  that he had been constant unconsciouslynay unintentionally that he had meant to forget her and believed itto be done  he had imagined himself indifferent when he had onlybeen angry and he had been unjust to her merits because he had beena sufferer from them  her character was now fixed on his mindas perfection itself maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitudeand gentleness but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at uppercrosshad he learnt to do her justice and only at lyme had he begunto understand himself  at lyme he had received lessonsof more than one sort  the passing admiration of mr elliothad at least roused him and the scenes on the cobb and atcaptain harville's had fixed her superiorityin his preceding attempts to attach himself to louisa musgrovethe attempts of angry pride he protested that he had for everfelt it to be impossible that he had not cared could not carefor louisa though till that day till the leisure for reflectionwhich followed it he had not understood the perfect excellenceof the mind with which louisa's could so ill bear a comparisonor the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his ownthere he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principleand the obstinacy of self-will between the darings of heedlessnessand the resolution of a collected mind  there he had seen everythingto exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost and there begunto deplore the pride the folly the madness of resentmentwhich had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his wayfrom that period his penance had become severe  he had no soonerbeen free from the horror and remorse attending the first few daysof louisa's accident no sooner begun to feel himself alive againthan he had begun to feel himself though alive not at libertyi found said he that i was considered by harville an engaged man!that neither harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of ourmutual attachment  i was startled and shocked  to a degreei could contradict this instantly but when i began to reflectthat others might have felt the same--her own family nayperhaps herself--i was no longer at my own disposal  i was hers in honourif she wished it  i had been unguarded  i had not thought seriouslyon this subject before  i had not considered that my excessive intimacymust have its danger of ill consequence in many ways and that i hadno right to be trying whether i could attach myself to either of the girlsat the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no otherill effects  i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequenceshe found too late in short that he had entangled himselfand that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caringfor louisa at all he must regard himself as bound to herif her sentiments for him were what the harvilles supposedit determined him to leave lyme and await her complete recovery elsewherehe would gladly weaken by any fair means whatever feelings orspeculations concerning him might exist and he went thereforeto his brother's meaning after a while to return to kellynchand act as circumstances might requirei was six weeks with edward said he and saw him happyi could have no other pleasure  i deserved none  he enquired after youvery particularly asked even if you were personally alteredlittle suspecting that to my eye you could never alteranne smiled and let it pass  it was too pleasing a blunderfor a reproach  it is something for a woman to be assuredin her eight-and-twentieth year that she has not lost one charmof earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increasedto anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to bethe result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachmenthe had remained in shropshire lamenting the blindness of his own prideand the blunders of his own calculations till at once released from louisaby the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagementwith benwickhere said he ended the worst of my state for now i could at leastput myself in the way of happiness i could exert myselfi could do something  but to be waiting so long in inactionand waiting only for evil had been dreadful  within the firstfive minutes i said `i will be at bath on wednesday' and i waswas it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come and to arrivewith some degree of hope  you were single  it was possible thatyou might retain the feelings of the past as i did and one encouragementhappened to be mine  i could never doubt that you would be loved andsought by others but i knew to a certainty that you had refused one manat least of better pretensions than myself and i could not helpoften saying `was this for me'their first meeting in milsom street afforded much to be saidbut the concert still more  that evening seemed to be made upof exquisite moments  the moment of her stepping forwardin the octagon room to speak to him  the moment of mr elliot's appearingand tearing her away and one or two subsequent momentsmarked by returning hope or increasing despondency were dwelt onwith energyto see you cried he in the midst of those who could not bemy well-wishers to see your cousin close by you conversing and smilingand feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!to consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hopeto influence you!  even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferentto consider what powerful supports would be his!  was it not enoughto make the fool of me which i appeared  how could i look onwithout agony  was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind youwas not the recollection of what had been the knowledge of her influencethe indelible immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--was it not all against meyou should have distinguished replied anne  you should not havesuspected me now the case is so different and my age is so differentif i was wrong in yielding to persuasion once remember thatit was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety not of riskwhen i yielded i thought it was to duty but no duty could be calledin aid here  in marrying a man indifferent to me all riskwould have been incurred and all duty violatedperhaps i ought to have reasoned thus he replied but i could noti could not derive benefit from the late knowledge i had acquiredof your character  i could not bring it into play it was overwhelmedburied lost in those earlier feelings which i had been smarting underyear after year  i could think of you only as one who had yieldedwho had given me up who had been influenced by any one rather than by mei saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of miseryi had no reason to believe her of less authority now  the force of habitwas to be addedi should have thought said anne that my manner to yourselfmight have spared you much or all of thisno no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagementto another man would give  i left you in this belief and yeti was determined to see you again  my spirits rallied with the morningand i felt that i had still a motive for remaining hereat last anne was at home again and happier than any one in that housecould have conceived  all the surprise and suspense and every otherpainful part of the morning dissipated by this conversationshe re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloyin some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to lastan interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best correctiveof everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity and she wentto her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulnessof her enjoymentthe evening came the drawing-rooms were lighted up the company assembledit was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who hadnever met before and those who met too often a commonplace businesstoo numerous for intimacy too small for variety but anne had never foundan evening shorter  glowing and lovely in sensibility and happinessand more generally admired than she thought about or cared forshe had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around hermr elliot was there she avoided but she could pity himthe wallises she had amusement in understanding them  lady dalrympleand miss carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to hershe cared not for mrs clay and had nothing to blush for inthe public manners of her father and sister  with the musgrovesthere was the happy chat of perfect ease with captain harvillethe kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister with lady russellattempts at conversation which a delicious consciousness cut shortwith admiral and mrs croft everything of peculiar cordiality andfervent interest which the same consciousness sought to concealand with captain wentworth some moments of communicationscontinually occurring and always the hope of more and alwaysthe knowledge of his being thereit was in one of these short meetings each apparently occupiedin admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants that she said--i have been thinking over the past and trying impartiallyto judge of the right and wrong i mean with regard to myselfand i must believe that i was right much as i suffered from itthat i was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whomyou will love better than you do now  to me she was in the placeof a parent  do not mistake me however  i am not sayingthat she did not err in her advice  it was perhaps one of those casesin which advice is good or bad only as the event decidesand for myself i certainly never should in any circumstanceof tolerable similarity give such advice  but i mean that i was rightin submitting to her and that if i had done otherwise i should havesuffered more in continuing the engagement than i did even in giving it upbecause i should have suffered in my conscience  i have nowas far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature nothingto reproach myself with and if i mistake not a strong sense of dutyis no bad part of a woman's portionhe looked at her looked at lady russell and looking again at herreplied as if in cool deliberation--not yet  but there are hopes of her being forgiven in timei trust to being in charity with her soon  but i too have beenthinking over the past and a  question has suggested itselfwhether there may not have been one person more my enemyeven than that lady  my own self  tell me if when i returnedto england in the year eight with a few thousand poundsand was posted into the laconia if i had then written to youwould you have answered my letter  would you in shorthave renewed the engagement thenwould i! was all her answer but the accent was decisive enoughgood god! he cried you would!  it is not that i did not think of itor desire it as what could alone crown all my other successbut i was proud too proud to ask again  i did not understand youi shut my eyes and would not understand you or do you justicethis is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every onesooner than myself  six years of separation and sufferingmight have been spared  it is a sort of pain too which is new to mei have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earnevery blessing that i enjoyed  i have valued myself on honourable toilsand just rewards  like other great men under reverses he addedwith a smile i must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortunei must learn to brook being happier than i deservechapter 24who can be in doubt of what followed  when any two young peopletake it into their heads to marry they are pretty sure by perseveranceto carry their point be they ever so poor or ever so imprudentor ever so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfortthis may be bad morality to conclude with but i believe it to be truthand if such parties succeed how should a captain wentworth andan anne elliot with the advantage of maturity of mindconsciousness of right and one independent fortune between themfail of bearing down every opposition  they might in facthave borne down a great deal more than they met with for there waslittle to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmthsir walter made no objection and elizabeth did nothing worsethan look cold and unconcerned  captain wentworth with five-and-twentythousand pounds and as high in his profession as merit and activitycould place him was no longer nobody  he was now esteemed quite worthyto address the daughter of a foolish spendthrift baronetwho had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himselfin the situation in which providence had placed him and who couldgive his daughter at present but a small part of the shareof ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereaftersir walter indeed though he had no affection for anneand no vanity flattered to make him really happy on the occasionwas very far from thinking it a bad match for her  on the contrarywhen he saw more of captain wentworth saw him repeatedly by daylightand eyed him well he was very much struck by his personal claimsand felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balancedagainst her superiority of rank and all this assisted byhis well-sounding name enabled sir walter at last to prepare his penwith a very good grace for the insertion of the marriagein the volume of honourthe only one among them whose opposition of feeling could exciteany serious anxiety was lady russell  anne knew that lady russellmust be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing mr elliotand be making some struggles to become truly acquainted withand do justice to captain wentworth  this however was whatlady russell had now to do  she must learn to feel that she hadbeen mistaken with regard to both that she had been unfairly influencedby appearances in each that because captain wentworth's mannershad not suited her own ideas she had been too quick in suspecting themto indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity and that becausemr elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their proprietyand correctness their general politeness and suavity she had beentoo quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correctopinions and well-regulated mind  there was nothing lessfor lady russell to do than to admit that she had beenpretty completely wrong and to take up a new set of opinionsand of hopesthere is a quickness of perception in some a nicety in the discernmentof character a natural penetration in short which no experiencein others can equal and lady russell had been less giftedin this part of understanding than her young friend  but she wasa very good woman and if her second object was to be sensibleand well-judging her first was to see anne happy  she loved annebetter than she loved her own abilities and when the awkwardnessof the beginning was over found little hardship in attaching herselfas a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other childof all the family mary was probably the one most immediately gratifiedby the circumstance  it was creditable to have a sister marriedand she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumentalto the connexion by keeping anne with her in the autumnand as her own sister must be better than her husband's sistersit was very agreeable that captain wentworth should be a richer man thaneither captain benwick or charles hayter  she had something to sufferperhaps when they came into contact again in seeing anne restoredto the rights of seniority and the mistress of a very pretty landaulettebut she had a future to look forward to of powerful consolationanne had no uppercross hall before her no landed estateno headship of a family and if they could but keep captain wentworthfrom being made a baronet she would not change situations with anneit would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfiedwith her situation for a change is not very probable thereshe had soon the mortification of seeing mr elliot withdrawand no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raiseeven the unfounded hopes which sunk with himthe news of his cousins anne's engagement burst on mr elliotmost unexpectedly  it deranged his best plan of domestic happinesshis best hope of keeping sir walter single by the watchfulnesswhich a son-in-law's rights would have given  but though discomfitedand disappointed he could still do something for his own interestand his own enjoyment  he soon quitted bath and on mrs clay'squitting it soon afterwards and being next heard of as establishedunder his protection in london it was evident how double a gamehe had been playing and how determined he was to save himselffrom being cut out by one artful woman at leastmrs clay's affections had overpowered her interest and she had sacrificedfor the young man's sake the possibility of scheming longerfor sir walter  she has abilities however as well as affectionsand it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning or hersmay finally carry the day whether after preventing her from beingthe wife of sir walter he may not be wheedled and caressed at lastinto making her the wife of sir williamit cannot be doubted that sir walter and elizabeth were shockedand mortified by the loss of their companion and the discovery oftheir deception in her  they had their great cousins to be sureto resort to for comfort but they must long feel that to flatterand follow others without being flattered and followed in turnis but a state of half enjoymentanne satisfied at a very early period of lady russell's meaningto love captain wentworth as she ought had no other alloyto the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousnessof having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could valuethere she felt her own inferiority very keenly  the disproportionin their fortune was nothing it did not give her a moment's regretbut to have no family to receive and estimate him properlynothing of respectability of harmony of good will to offerin return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met herin his brothers and sisters was a source of as lively painas her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwisestrong felicity  she had but two friends in the world to add to his listlady russell and mrs smith  to those however he was very well disposedto attach himself  lady russell in spite of all her former transgressionshe could now value from his heart  while he was not obliged to saythat he believed her to have been right in originally dividing themhe was ready to say almost everything else in her favourand as for mrs smith she had claims of various kinds to recommend herquickly and permanentlyher recent good offices by anne had been enough in themselvesand their marriage instead of depriving her of one friendsecured her two  she was their earliest visitor in their settled lifeand captain wentworth by putting her in the way of recoveringher husband's property in the west indies by writing for heracting for her and seeing her through all the petty difficultiesof the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless manand a determined friend fully requited the services whichshe had rendered or ever meant to render to his wifemrs smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of incomewith some improvement of health and the acquisition of such friendsto be often with for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did notfail her and while these prime supplies of good remained she might havebid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperityshe might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthyand yet be happy  her spring of felicity was in the glowof her spirits as her friend anne's was in the warmth of her heartanne was tenderness itself and she had the full worth of itin captain wentworth's affection  his profession was all that could evermake her friends wish that tenderness less the dread of a future warall that could dim her sunshine  she gloried in being a sailor's wifebut she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that professionwhich is if possible more distinguished in its domestic virtuesthan in its national importance        finisend of the project gutenberg etext of persuasion by jane austin
