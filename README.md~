# StylometryProject

This is a stylometry project by [Ronnie Nyaga](http://twitter.com/ronnie_nyaga) for his fourth year Computer Science project.


The project uses the Quinlan ID3 algorithm in Decision Trees to learn the written linguistic styles of students in their essays, and thus determine the integrity of the authorship of subsequent essays handed in by the students.

This was application is coded using [*Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org). The key gems that serve the core functionality of this application are [*Ai4r](http://ai4r.org) and [*decisiontrees](https://www.igvita.com/2007/04/16/decision-tree-learning-in-ruby/)
